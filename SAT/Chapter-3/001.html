      <h2 _ngcontent-oly-c287="">Vocabulary</h2>
      <p _ngcontent-oly-c287="">
        In Chapter Two, we offered you some tips for taking the SAT, including
        ways to keep from getting tricked by the questions. In this chapter, we
        want to give you insight into figuring out the verbal sections of the
        exam. The bottom line is this:&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c287=""
          >If you’re going to be successful on this part of the test, you have
          to know more than how to attack the questions.</strong
        >I You must be able to figure out the meaning of words in the context in
        which they are found.
      </p>
      <p _ngcontent-oly-c287="">
        We could give you a huge list of vocabulary words to memorize, but let’s
        be honest, you won’t memorize them. Even if you do memorize them, you’ll
        still only know the words on the list. The very best way to learn
        vocabulary is to&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c287=""
          >READ EXTENSIVELY</strong
        >. However, this is a crash course, so reading extensively between now
        and the test date might be out of the question. Instead, let’s focus on
        what you can do to score well on the verbal sections of the test.

          >The next best (and quickest) way to learn vocabulary is to review
          root words, prefixes, and suffixes.</strong
        >&nbsp;Although not every word that appears on the SAT has a
        recognizable root, knowing root words will still help you figure out
        some of the words that you don’t know. You won’t know every word on the
        test anyway - the test writers design it that way! Peruse the prefixes,
        suffixes, and root words in the following charts. Thinking of a word you
        already know that uses each prefix, suffix, or root may help you
        understand what the word on the test means.

      <p _ngcontent-oly-c287="">
        If you really want to memorize a long list of words that may appear on
        the test, there are plenty of lists, many available simply by searching
        online. Alternatively, you can get help in learning the words in context
        by reading Tooth and Nail: A Novel Approach, by Charles Harrington
        Elster and Joseph Elliott — a fictional work that incorporates, in its
        plot, the most common vocabulary words appearing in SAT tests. However,
        despite how helpful knowing the definitions of specific words may be,
        learning vocabulary through etymology and an understanding of prefixes
        and suffixes is still essential to success on the SAT Reasoning Test.

      <p _ngcontent-oly-c287="">
        Although sentence completion questions are no longer a part of the SAT,
        the more vocabulary you know, the better you will be able to cope with
        the vocabulary found on the test.
