        <h2 _ngcontent-oly-c287="">Chapter Three: Verbal Skills</h2>
        <h2 _ngcontent-oly-c287="">Vocabulary</h2>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c287="">In Chapter Two, we offered you some tips for taking the SAT, including ways to keep
            from getting tricked by the questions. In this chapter, we want to give you insight into figuring out the
            verbal sections of the exam. The bottom line is this:&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c287="">If you’re going to
                be successful on this part of the test, you have to know more than how to attack the
                questions.</strong>I You must be able to figure out the meaning of words in the context in which they
            are found.</p>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c287="">We could give you a huge list of vocabulary words to memorize, but let’s be honest,
            you won’t memorize them. Even if you do memorize them, you’ll still only know the words on the list. The
            very best way to learn vocabulary is to&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c287="">READ EXTENSIVELY</strong>.
            However, this is a crash course, so reading extensively between now and the test date might be out of the
            question. Instead, let’s focus on what you can do to score well on the verbal sections of the test.</p>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c287=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c287="">The next best (and quickest) way to learn vocabulary is
                to review root words, prefixes, and suffixes.</strong>&nbsp;Although not every word that appears on the
            SAT has a recognizable root, knowing root words will still help you figure out some of the words that you
            don’t know. You won’t know every word on the test anyway - the test writers design it that way! Peruse the
            prefixes, suffixes, and root words in the following charts. Thinking of a word you already know that uses
            each prefix, suffix, or root may help you understand what the word on the test means.</p>

                Prefixes and Suffixes</a></h2>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c287="">If you really want to memorize a long list of words that may appear on the test, there
            are plenty of lists, many available simply by searching online. Alternatively, you can get help in learning
            the words in context by reading Tooth and Nail: A Novel Approach, by Charles Harrington Elster and Joseph
            Elliott — a fictional work that incorporates, in its plot, the most common vocabulary words appearing in SAT
            tests. However, despite how helpful knowing the definitions of specific words may be, learning vocabulary
            through etymology and an understanding of prefixes and suffixes is still essential to success on the SAT
            Reasoning Test.</p>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c287="">Although sentence completion questions are no longer a part of the SAT, the more
            vocabulary you know, the better you will be able to cope with the vocabulary found on the test.</p>
