        <h2 _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Chapter Three: Critical Reading</h2>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Many students who have taken the SAT will tell you that the critical reading section
            is the most difficult part of the exam. Why? It is because the lengthy passages require you to stay focused!
            In order to stay awake and to concentrate during the critical reading section of the SAT, you must
            remember&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">one important rule: Stay engaged with the text. In other words,
                interact with the passages in front of you.</strong></p>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c267="">You will see the phrases&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Evidence-based
                Reading</strong>&nbsp;(and&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Evidence-based
                Writing/Language</strong>). All this means is that the answers to the questions are located in the text.
            Since so many of the passages are now actual documents such as speeches, excepts from governmental
            publications, and short excepts from nonfiction (in addition to fiction) materials, the answers will be
            found from evidence provided in the passages.</p>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Three types of passages are presented on the test: History/Social Studies (2
            passages), Social/Natural Science (2 passages), Narrative—either fiction or nonfiction (1 passage). One of
            these will be presented as paired passages, that is, there will be 2 shorter passages rather than one long
            passage.</p>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Here’s how to stay engaged with the text:</p>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c267="">First,&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">write on the passage</strong>. Underline
            information that you think may be important.&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Underline transitional or
                signal words</strong>&nbsp;such as however, therefore, since, nevertheless, and above all. Circle words
            that are unfamiliar to you. Put stars next to examples the author provides.&nbsp;<strong
                _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Make brief notes in the margins</strong>&nbsp;about the author’s purpose, point,
            or attitude. Writing on the passage serves three important purposes. It helps you to make more sense of what
            you’re reading, it helps you to remember what you’ve read, and, here’s the clincher, it helps you to stay
            tuned in while you’re reading!</p>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c267="">The&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">second way to stay engaged</strong>&nbsp;with
            the text is&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">to keep a conversation going in your head while you’re
                reading</strong>. Go ahead. No one else will know. Talk back to the author of the passage. Ask him
            questions like “What point are you trying to make?” or “Why did you describe the situation that way?” Make
            accusations like “Wow, you obviously don’t like this character very much” or “Well, I can tell you think
            global warming is nothing but a scam.” Get inside his head by saying “You’re trying to be sarcastic, aren’t
            you?” or “Oh, I see where you’re going with this example.” These conversations may feel awkward at first,
            but good readers have them all the time. They help you to think like the author (which means you’ll have an
            easier time answering the questions), and they help you to (once again) stay tuned in to the reading!</p>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Although interacting with the passages is important,&nbsp;<strong
                _ngcontent-oly-c267="">keep in mind that you have a time limit</strong>: so don’t get too carried away.
            Go&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">through the passage one time, marking it and talking to it as you
                go</strong>. Don’t dwell on any one aspect of the passage. Then&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">go
                to the questions. Read through each one, and answer the ones you know first, and then go back to the
                ones about which you are unsure. When you’re going back to the passage to figure these out, keep this in
                mind: Generally, the questions follow the order of the passage.</strong>&nbsp;In other words, you should
            be able to find the answer to the first question near the beginning of the passage. The last questions,
            however, will pertain to the passage as a whole.</p>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c267="">You’ll have to answer questions about the author’s point of view and how the author
            uses his words to establish that point of view. Specifically, you need practice in figuring out a passage’s
            main idea, the author’s attitude or tone toward the subject matter, and what the passage implies (says
            indirectly or between the lines). You’ll also need to be able to compare and contrast aspects of the paired
            passages questions. Sometimes you will be asked to figure out the meaning of a word in context. In this
            case, the question will give you the line location of the word. Perhaps you will have already identified the
            word as one that is unfamiliar to you. Either way, you’ll need to read the sentence (and possibly the ones
            immediately before and after it) and look for context clues—words in the sentence that give away the meaning
            of the target word.</p><iframe _ngcontent-oly-c267="" width="560" height="315"

        <p _ngcontent-oly-c267="">To sum up: You will see these types of questions on the Reading section.</p>
        <ul _ngcontent-oly-c267="">
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Main idea</strong>: of a passage or a paragraph.
                Questions relating to the entire passage, such as main concept questions should be answered last after
                you have worked through the other questions connected with the passage.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Fact</strong>: questions asking for specific bits
                of data or information. Fact questions can also ask for relationships such as cause/effect or
                compare/contrast. The answers to fact questions are often paraphrased so you will have to look for
                parallel ideas.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Inference</strong>: the classic “educated guess.”
                You will be asked to put facts together to come up with a logical conclusion. Point of view questions
                are a type of inference that is based on the feelings or viewpoint of the author or a character in the
                case of narrative passages.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Vocabulary in Context</strong>: In the vocabulary
                section, you have seen how context is the most important tool you have to figure out the meaning of
                words. Use it!</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Evidence</strong>: These questions ask you to find
                the specific location of material on which you have based your answer (usually to the previous
                question). Typically, four sentences or phrases are given and you must decide which of the four supports
                the answer you have chosen.</li>
        </ul>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c267=""> Finally, some questions will refer to literary terms. These may also be found in the
            Writing/Language section of the test. A quick review of the following terms may be helpful: </p>
        <ul _ngcontent-oly-c267="">
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Alliteration</strong>: repetition of sounds at the
                beginning of words (cowering in the corner of their cages)</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Allusion</strong>: a reference to something
                commonly known (If it continues to rain, we will have to build an ark.)</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Assonance</strong>: repetition of vowel sounds
                within words (rode through the snow)</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Cliché</strong>: a trite, overused expression (as
                pretty as a picture)</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Foreshadowing</strong>: hinting at what is to come
            </li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Hyperbole</strong>: an exaggeration (I ate so much
                dessert that I probably gained a hundred pounds!) </li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Imagery</strong>: description that appeals to the
                senses (dry leaves crunching underfoot like broken glass)</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Irony</strong>: incongruity between what is
                expected and what occurs or between what is said and what is meant (a butcher who is a vegetarian)</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Metaphor</strong>: a direct comparison in which
                one thing represents another (the world is a stage)</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Motif</strong>: a recurring subject, theme, or
                idea</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Onomatopoeia</strong>: the use of words that
                imitate sounds (swish, pop, buzz)</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Oxymoron</strong>: a pairing of contradictory
                terms (deafening silence)</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Paradox</strong>: a statement that seems
                self-contradictory (less is more)</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Personification</strong>: giving human
                characteristics to inanimate objects (daffodils danced in the breeze)</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Pun</strong>: humorous use of words that sound
                alike but have different meanings (Will the mayor be re-elected? He “mayor” may not!)</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Rhetorical Question</strong>: question meant to
                make a point, not to be answered (What’s the point of having the rule if it isn’t enforced?)</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Sarcasm</strong>: harsh or bitter irony (telling
                someone who is always late, “Oh, I see you’re on time as usual.”)</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Simile</strong>: a comparison that uses like or as
                (as sweet as honey)</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Symbol</strong>: something used to represent
                something else</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Theme</strong>: the main or unifying idea
                (loneliness, forgiveness, love)</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c267=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c267="">Tone</strong>: author’s attitude toward his
