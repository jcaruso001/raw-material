          These types of questions address matters of style, organization, and
          the authorâ€™s purpose or feelings. For the most part they ask you to
          consider the passage as a whole but do at times reference parts of
          paragraphs such as the following example.

        <p _ngcontent-fbe-c279="">Example:</p>
        <p _ngcontent-fbe-c279="" class="font-italic">
          We visited a local animal shelter on Saturday. We wanted to pick out a
          new dog. As we walked through the corridor, each dog had its own way
          of sharing something about its personality. Some dogs barked, others
          jumped up and down, and still others cowered in the corners of their
          cages. We visited with several different dogs, but the one who stole
          our hearts was Bogart. This big, black dog with droopy ears and a
          wagging tail is now the newest member of our family.
