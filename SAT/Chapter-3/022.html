Elizabeth Roberts-Pedersen is a lecturer in history at the University of Western Sydney in Australia. (This passage was edited for length.

It is also 100 years since&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-oly-c284="">The Lancet</em>&nbsp;published Charles S. Meyers’ article, “A Contribution to the Study of Shell Sock.”</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c284="">The Study of Shell Shock</strong></p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(2) Myers’ article is generally regarded as the first use of the term “shell shock” in medical literature. It was used as a descriptor for “three cases of loss of memory, vision, smell and taste” in British soldiers admitted to a military hospital in France.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(3) While Myers presented these cases as evidence of the spectacular concussive effects of artillery on the Western Front, British medical opinion soon came to regard these symptoms as psychological in origin. The men presenting to medical officers with tics, tremors, and palpitations, as well as more serious symptoms of “functional” blindness, paralysis, and loss of speech, were not concussed—but nor were they necessarily cowards or malingerers.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(4) Instead, these were men simply worn down by the unprecedented stresses of trench warfare—in particular, the effort required to push out of one’s mind the prospect of joining the ranks of the maimed or the corpses lying in no man’s land…</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(5) For contemporaries and later for historians, shell shock came to encapsulate all the horror of this new form of industrialized warfare. As historian Jay Winter suggests, it moved “from a diagnosis into a metaphor…”</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c284="">Developing a Diagnosis</strong></p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(6) It is tempting to view shell shock as the unambiguous turning point in psychiatry’s history, popularizing the idea that unconscious processes might produce symptoms that operate separately from moral qualities such as endurance and courage. However, scholarship over the last 15 years suggest that this position was far from widely accepted.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(7) …The notion that many patients had some “predisposing” weakness—independent of their combat experiences—persisted throughout the interwar period and into the Second World War.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(8) It wasn’t until the Vietnam War that this formulation was reversed, which in turn bridged the gap between combatant syndromes and the civilian sphere.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(9) This development is only comprehensible as part of a broader political context. The notion that the Vietnam War exacted a form of psychic damage on American soldiers was championed by the anti-war activists of Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) and psychiatrists Chaim Shatan and Robert Jay Lifton. “Post-Vietnam syndrome,” Shatan wrote, was caused by the “unconsummated grief” of a brutal and brutalizing war.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(10) The VVAW’s advocacy was instrumental in securing official recognition for this condition. It was included in 1980 in the third edition of the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-oly-c284="">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III)</em>&nbsp;as “post-traumatic stress disorder.”</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(11) PTSD’s inclusion in&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-oly-c284="">DSM-III</em>&nbsp;legitimated the suffering of Vietnam veterans and held out the possibility of subsidized medical care and compensation. But the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-oly-c284="">DSM-III</em>&nbsp;definition of PTSD was significant in two additional ways.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(12) First, it identified the disorder as a condition that could afflict soldiers and civilians alike—not a diagnosis exclusive to combat, like shell shock.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(13) Second, it focused attention on the continuing effects of a traumatic experience, rather than on the personality and constitution of the patient.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(14) The ramifications of these changes have been immense. PTSD and a broader field of “traumatology” are now entrenched in psychiatric and popular discourse. In Australia, we now assume that warfare is objectively traumatizing, and that governments ought to provide medical and financial support for affected services personnel, even if a recent Four Corners program confirmed that this is not always the case.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c284="">How is PTSD viewed today?</strong></p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(15) Though PTSD has its origins in opposition to the Vietnam War, the politics of the condition are now largely ambivalent, with its significance shifting according to circumstance.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(16) This point is well illustrated the film&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-oly-c284="">American Sniper</em>, which demonstrates the possibility of two contrary positions. After this return to civilian life SEAL sniper Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) is shown to be suffering from some characteristic after-effects of combat…</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(17) The real Chris Kyle was shot dead by Eddie Ray Routh [another veteran] in 2013. At trial, the accused’s lawyers pursued a defense of insanity, compounded by the inadequate care provided by veterans’ mental health services. Routh was found guilty of Kyle’s murder in March of 2015.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284="">(18) In the 100 years since Myers’ article on shell shock, the psychological consequences of war remain as relevant as ever.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c284=""><em _ngcontent-oly-c284=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c284="">Write an essay in which you explain how the writer builds an argument to persuade her audience that she is offering proof of war’s traumatic history.
