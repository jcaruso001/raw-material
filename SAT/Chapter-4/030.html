When we solve for the solution, or what for values of x and y the system of equations is true, we are finding the x- and y-coordinates of the point where the two lines in the system intersect. This gives us one solution, one value each for x and y. However, not all lines intersect. Parallel lines, by definition, never cross. Since the lines never cross, a system of two parallel lines will never have a solution.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c343=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c343="">Example 1</strong>: What is the solution to the system of equations?</p><img _ngcontent-oly-c343="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1596686343/2019/SAT/ManySolutions.png"><p _ngcontent-oly-c343="">By looking at the equations of each line we can see that both lines have a slope of 5. Since the lines have the same slope, they must be parallel. Parallel lines never cross so there is no solution to this system of equations.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c343=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c343="">Example 2:</strong>&nbsp;For what value of m will this system of equations have no solution?</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c343="">y = 3x – 9<br _ngcontent-oly-c343="">y = mx + 1</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c343="">In order for a system of equations to have no solution, the two lines must be parallel. Parallel lines have the same slope. The slope of the first line is 3, so in order for the second line to be parallel, it must also have a slope of 3. Thus m = 3.<br _ngcontent-oly-c343="">Lines with the same slope are parallel and have no solution, lines with different slopes intersect at one point and have one solution, what about lines that are just a constant multiple of each other? Consider the lines</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c343="">y = 3x + 4<br _ngcontent-oly-c343="">2y = 6x + 8</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c343="">The second line is just 2 times the first line. 2(y = 3x + 4) → 2y = 6x + 8. The second line is in the same place as the first line, it is just 2 times as long. In fact, the second line is lying directly on top of the first line. Since the lines are on top of each other, they are touching at infinitely many points. Thus, lines that are constant multiples of each other have infinitely many solutions.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c343=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c343="">Example 3:</strong>&nbsp;For which value of m will the following lines have an infinite number of solutions?
</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c343="">y = −4x + 5<br _ngcontent-oly-c343="">−3y = mx −15</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c343="">In order for the lines to have infinitely many solutions, the lines must be constant multiples of each other. In this case, the second line is just −3 times the first line. We multiple the first line by −3 to determine what the equation of the second line should be.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c343="">−3(y = −4x + 5) → −3y = 12x −15</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c343="">The slope of the second line should be 12. Thus, m = 12.</p></app-solutions><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----></div>
