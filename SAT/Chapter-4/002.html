The test writers are typically going to consider the positive multiples of a number. They may even refer to the positive multiples as simply the multiples. However, multiples of a number can be negative as well. Note that –4, –8, –12, –16, and –20 are also multiples of 4. Although the chances it will come up on the test may be small, it certainly doesn’t hurt to know that zero is a multiple of every number, since zero is an integer and any number x 0 = 0.&nbsp;</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c319="">The lowest (positive) multiple shared by two numbers is called the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-oly-c319=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c319="">least common multiple</strong></em>. The multiples of 3 and 8 are shown below:&nbsp;</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c319=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c319="">Multiples of 3</strong>: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, …<br _ngcontent-oly-c319=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c319="">Multiples of 8</strong>: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, …</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c319="">As you can see, the first multiple to appear in both lists is 24. Therefore, 24 is the least common<br _ngcontent-oly-c319="">multiple of 3 and 8.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c319=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c319="">A&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-oly-c319="">factor</em>&nbsp;of a number is any (positive) integer that evenly divides (remainder of 0) into the number. The number 18</strong>&nbsp;has factors of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. Because 18/18 = 1, 18 / 9 = 2, 18 / 6 = 3, 18 / 3 = 6, 18 / 2 = 9, and 18/1 = 18. Any given number is a multiple of each its factors. The term&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-oly-c319=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c319="">greatest common factor</strong></em>&nbsp;is given to&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c319="">the largest factor shared by two numbers</strong>. The greatest common factor of 21 and 28 is 7, since 7 is the largest number that is a factor of both numbers. Although it is unlikely that you will simply be asked to factor a number for the test, being able to factor numbers will be important to answering many of the questions.&nbsp;</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c319=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c319="">A&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-oly-c319="">prime number</em>&nbsp;is any integer greater than 1 whose only factors (positive divisors) are 1 and itself</strong>. Three (3) is a prime number because the only factors of 3 are 1 and 3. Six (6) is not a prime number because the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Although we won’t get into why here, note that 1 is not considered a prime number. We can write every positive integer as a unique product of prime numbers. This is referred to as the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-oly-c319="">prime factorization</em>&nbsp;of a number. The number 4620 has a prime factorization of 2•2•3•5•7•11. Two numbers are said to be&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-oly-c319="">relatively prime</em>&nbsp;if they have no factors (other than 1) in common. The numbers 198 = 2•3•3•11, and 455 = 5•7•13, are relatively prime because they share no common factors in their prime factorization.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c319="">When completely factoring a number, begin by removing any obvious factors such as 2, 5, and<br _ngcontent-oly-c319="">10. This will make it easier to examine any of the less obvious factors. In factoring a number, the following divisibility rules will be helpful.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c319=""></p><ol _ngcontent-oly-c319="" class="m-5"><li _ngcontent-oly-c319="">One (1) is a factor of any whole number.</li><li _ngcontent-oly-c319=""> Any even number (ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8) will be divisible by 2. <ol _ngcontent-oly-c319="" class="mx-5"><li _ngcontent-oly-c319="">256 is divisible by 2, while 221 is not.</li></ol></li><li _ngcontent-oly-c319="">An odd number is any number that is not even (not divisible by 2).</li><li _ngcontent-oly-c319=""> Add up the digits in the number.
