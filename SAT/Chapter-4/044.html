Data is gathered from a sample and those statistics are used to estimate information about the population. There are various ways of gathering data from a sample. You should familiarize yourself with these methods.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c316=""></p><ul _ngcontent-oly-c316=""><li _ngcontent-oly-c316="">Random Sample: Objects are selected at random such that each object is chosen by chance and each object has an equal probability of being selected</li><li _ngcontent-oly-c316="">Experiment: A study conducted to explore a cause and effect relationship</li><li _ngcontent-oly-c316="">Double Blind: Subjects are divided into two separate groups. One group is given the real experiment and the other is given a fake. Neither group knows if they are in the real group or the fake.</li><li _ngcontent-oly-c316="">Survey: The process of collecting data often by asking the same questions to a selection of people</li></ul><br _ngcontent-oly-c316="">It is possible for some of these terms to be combined, such as a random sample survey.
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c316=""> When data is collected, we often end up with a&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c316="">margin of error</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c316="">confidence level</strong>. The margin of error tells us the range of values below and above the sample statistic in which the real population value should reside. If our margin of error is 10%, then the value of our data should fall within Â±10% of the value. The confidence level has absolutely nothing to do with human confidence. Do not let the name fool you! The confidence level tells us what percent of similar samples will contain the population value the sample statistic is estimating. An 80% confidence level tells us that 80% of similar samples will contain the population value inside the margin of error.<br _ngcontent-oly-c316=""><br _ngcontent-oly-c316=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c316="">Example:</strong>&nbsp;A sample of certain microorganisms was observed. The microorganisms were observed to have an average life cycle of 12 hours with a 5% margin of error and a 95% confidence level. Which of the following statements must be true?
        </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c316=""> A) We are 95% confident that the average life cycle of the microorganisms is between 11.4 and 12.6 hours.<br _ngcontent-oly-c316=""> B) There is a 95% chance that the life cycle of the microorganisms 12.05 hours<br _ngcontent-oly-c316=""> C) 95% of the samples should show that the average life cycle of the microorganisms is between 11.4 and 12.6 hours<br _ngcontent-oly-c316=""> D) 95% of the microorganisms had a life cycle that was 12.05 hours.
        </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c316=""> Confidence level has nothing to do with human confidence, so we can automatically eliminate A. In B, the margin of error was just converted to a decimal and added to the 12 instead of calculating 5% of 12 and adding and subtracting that value. Similarly, D is incorrect. This leaves C which appropriately describes the meaning of confidence level and correctly calculates the margin of error.
