Weâ€™ll review here a few of the most important concepts that you will need to be successful on these questions.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c332="">Probability</strong></p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332="">When answering these problems, keep in mind that the probability can be any number from 0 to 1 inclusive. If an event is not possible (cannot ever occur), the probability is 0. If an event is certain (will always occur), the probability is 1. You will never have a probability that is less than 0 or greater than 1. The probability formula can be used to calculate the probability of an event occurring.</p><img _ngcontent-oly-c332="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1598234157/2019/SAT/Screen_Shot_2020-06-24_at_12.08.53_PM.png"><p _ngcontent-oly-c332="">The probability is simply the ratio of the number of successful events divided by the total number of possible events. In a deck of 52 playing cards, the probability of pulling one of the twelve face cards is 12/52 or 3/13. In contrast, the probability of drawing one of the four jacks is 4/52 or 1/13.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c332="">Dependent and Independent Events</strong></p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332="">Calculating the probability of a single event is typically pretty simple. However, you may be asked to calculate the probability that two (or possibly more) events will both occur, called joint probability. In order to answer such a question, you will need to understand the difference between&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-oly-c332="">dependent</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-oly-c332="">independent</em>&nbsp;events. Events are considered independent if the outcome of one event does not affect the probability of the other event. If you roll two dice, the number that comes up on the first die does not affect the second die. If you pick an object out of a bag and replace it before picking another, what you picked first does not affect what you pick second. These are independent events.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332="">Events are considered&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-oly-c332="">dependent</em>&nbsp;if the outcome of one event affects the probability of the other event. If you pick an object out of a bag and do not replace it before picking another, what you picked first affects what you can pick second. These events are dependent.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332="">To calculate joint probability, you multiply the individual probabilities together.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c332="">Example 1:</strong>&nbsp;If you roll two dice, what is the probability that you roll two even numbers?</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332="">These two events are independent of each other so we find the probability of each event and multiply them together. There are 3 even numbers on a die and 6 total possibilities.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332="">3/6 x 3/6<br _ngcontent-oly-c332="">= 9/36<br _ngcontent-oly-c332="">= 1/4</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c332="">Example 2:</strong>&nbsp;A bag contains 3 red marbles 5 yellow marbles and 2 blue marbles. If you remove three marbles one at a time without replacement, what is the probability you pick 3 yellow marbles?</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332="">These three events are dependent of each other so we have to remember that the number of yellow marbles and the total number of marbles keeps reducing by one.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332="">5/10 x 4/9 x 3/8<br _ngcontent-oly-c332="">= 60/720<br _ngcontent-oly-c332="">= 1/12</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332="">The last kind of probability that is mentioned on the SAT is conditional probability. Conditional probability is the probability of an event given certain constraints. Conditional probabilities are most commonly displayed in a table. The given statement tells you which row or column to use.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c332="">Example 3:</strong>&nbsp;Keisha asked the students in her class if they preferred cats or dogs. The results are shown in the table below.</p><img _ngcontent-oly-c332="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1598234261/2019/SAT/Screen_Shot_2020-06-24_at_12.13.00_PM.png"><p _ngcontent-oly-c332=""><br _ngcontent-oly-c332="">What is the probability that a student prefers dogs given that they are a boy?</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332="">According to the given statement, the student is a boy, so we are only working in the column for Boys. 8 boys prefer dogs and there are a total of 12 boys.</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332="">8/12<br _ngcontent-oly-c332="">= 2/3</p><p _ngcontent-oly-c332=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c332="">Note:</strong>&nbsp;The probability of an event, A, is often written using the shorthand P(A). Thus, P(A) = 2/5 means the probability of event A occurring is 2/5.</p></app-probability-statistics><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----></div>
