It is highly unlikely that any will cover topics beyond the three most basic statistical measures: mean (arithmetic average), median, mode, and range. The mean of a set of n numbers is just the sum of the numbers divided by n (the number of items in the set). To find the mean or average of 15, 21, and 39 you would do the following:
    </p><img _ngcontent-oly-c349="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1596687516/2019/SAT/Statistics.png"><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> You may have to rely on your understanding of the properties of averages to arrive at an answer on the test when directly calculating the averages is difficult or time consuming. The average of two numbers is halfway between the two numbers on a number line. The average of 3 and 5 is 4.
    </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> Two concepts that often appear on the test deal with weighted averages and finding a missing number when an average is given. The average of a set of numbers is just the sum of the numbers divided by the number of terms in the set.
    </p><img _ngcontent-oly-c349="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1596687557/2019/SAT/Statistics-1.png"><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> Likewise, we can use the average and the number of terms to calculate the sum of the terms.
    </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> Sum of terms = (Average) x (# of terms)
    </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> This principle is central to both calculating a missing term and to the concept of a weighted average. If we are given the value for three of the four terms and the average, we can calculate the value of the missing term.
    </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> Three terms in a list of four are 17, 35, and 39.<br _ngcontent-oly-c349="">The average of all four terms is 34.
    </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> Sum of terms = 17 + 35 + 39 + x = 34 x 4 = 136<br _ngcontent-oly-c349="">91 + x = 136<br _ngcontent-oly-c349="">x = 45
    </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> If we are given that in a class of 16 girls and 13 boys, the boys averaged 75 on the last exam and the girls averaged 83, we can calculate the class average using a weighted average. Note that the average is not just the average of the boys’ and girls’ test averages.
    </p><img _ngcontent-oly-c349="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1596687651/2019/SAT/Statistics-2.png"><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> The average is slightly closer to 83 than it is to 75 because there are more girls in the class than boys.
    </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> The median of a set of data is just the term in the middle once the terms have been ordered from least to greatest. If there are two numbers in the middle of the data, simply take the average of the two terms. The mode of a set of data is the term that appears the most often. Finally, the range of a set of data is the value of the largest term minus the least term.
    </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> Example: Find the median, mode, and range of the set
    </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> 5, 6, 9, 3, 10, 6, 11, 13
    </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> To find the median we must first put the numbers in order from least to greatest.
    </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> 3, 5, 6, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13
    </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> There are two terms in the middle, 6 and 9. We must find their average.
    </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> 6 + 9/ 2<br _ngcontent-oly-c349="">= 15/2<br _ngcontent-oly-c349="">= 7.5<br _ngcontent-oly-c349="">The median is 7.5
    </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> To find the mode we identify which number shows up the most often.<br _ngcontent-oly-c349="">The mode is 6
    </p><p _ngcontent-oly-c349=""> To find the range we subtract the largest term and the least term.<br _ngcontent-oly-c349="">13 – 5 = 8<br _ngcontent-oly-c349="">The range is 8
