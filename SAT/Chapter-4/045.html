            <h2 _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Graphical Displays of Data</h2>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Data is often displayed in graphs. There are several different types of graphs
                that can be used.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Bar graphs are used to help visualize how different parts of the data compare to
                each other and help organize large sets of data.</p><img _ngcontent-oly-c313=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1598234678/2019/SAT/Screen_Shot_2020-06-24_at_12.20.13_PM.png">
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313=""><br _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Each bar shows how many rainy days there were for each
                month. From the graph we can easily tell things such as which month had the most or least days of rain,
                the average number of rainy days per month, and what seasons are the driest. Remember, we can only
                answer according to the information given in the graph. Even if we know something to be true, if it is
                not shown in the graph, that information cannot be a part of our answer. This is important! Pretend that
                you have forgotten everything about life and only know the information that the graph provides. This
                will help keep you from being distracted by answers that are true statements but are not based on the
                graph.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Line graphs are another good way to display data. They are very helpful for seeing
                how data changes.</p><img _ngcontent-oly-c313=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1598234578/2019/SAT/blue_line.png">
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">From this line graph we can see that the person started walking at a steady rate
                away from home. After 10 minutes, her distance from home stayed the same so she must have stopped
                walking. At 15 minutes she starts walking again, this time faster than before. At 25 minutes she turns
                around and starts slowly walking home.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Circle graphs or pie graphs are usually displayed with percentages. In order to
                find the value of each slice we will need to find the percent of the whole.</p><img
                _ngcontent-oly-c313=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1598234584/2019/SAT/pie.png">
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Example:</strong>&nbsp;What is the degree measure
                for the slice of the pie graph that represents the second quarter?</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">The second quarter holds 20% of the data so the degree measure will be 20% of the
                circle. There are 360° in a circle and 0.2×360=72. So, the degree measure for the slice of the pie graph
                that represents the second quarter is 72°.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Data can also be organized in a table.</p><img _ngcontent-oly-c313=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1598234602/2019/SAT/house_sale.png">
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Example:</strong>&nbsp;The table above shows the
                sale prices of the houses in a certain area. What is the median sale price?</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Remember, the median is the number in the middle after the data has been ordered
                from least to greatest. In this case we need to keep in mind how many houses of each price there are.
            </p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">&lt; $200,000 (130,500), $200,000-$300,000 (250,000), $300,000-$400,000 (375,200),
                &gt;$400,000 (150,000)</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">To find the amount that is in the middle, we need to work from the outside inward.
                We start by taking 130,500 houses off of each end.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">$200,000-300,000 (250,000), $300,000-400,000 (375,200), &gt;$400,000 (19,500)</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Now we take 19,500 houses off of each end</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">$200,000-300,000 (230,500), $300,000-400,000 (375,200)</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Now we take 230,500 houses off each end (We always take away the smaller of the
                two end values)</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">$300,000-$400,000 (144,700)</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Since $300,000-$400,000 is the only category left, the median must be in that
                category. Thus, the median sale price is $300,000-$400,000.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Another very common graphical display of data is the scatter plot. A scatter plot
                displays points comprised of two separate sets of data about the same objects or events. The scatter
                plot helps us see how the two sets of data correlate and helps us predict values not included on the
                graph.</p><img _ngcontent-oly-c313=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1598234607/2019/SAT/chemistry.png">
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313=""><br _ngcontent-oly-c313="">We can see from this plot that the points move in the
                positive direction in a linear pattern. Thus the data has a positive linear correlation. We can show
                this correlation better with the line of best fit. The graph below shows the same data points with the
                line of best fit included.</p><img _ngcontent-oly-c313=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1598234598/2019/SAT/line_diamond.png">
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313=""><br _ngcontent-oly-c313="">The line of best fit will have the same number of
                points above and below the line.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Example:</strong>&nbsp;What is the equation of the
                line of best fit?</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">From the graph it looks like the line contains the points (50, 52) and (55, 57).
            </p><img _ngcontent-oly-c313=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1598234591/2019/SAT/m_57.png">
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313=""><br _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Since we cannot really tell what points are actually on
                the line, our equation is just a very good estimate for the actual line of best fit (y = 0.9979x +
                1.474). Since the test is multiple choice, our estimate should be enough to lead us to the correct
                answer.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313=""><strong _ngcontent-oly-c313="">Example:</strong>&nbsp;What is the expected quiz
                grade for Chemistry when the Algebra quiz grade is 65?</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">All we have to do is plug in our Algebra quiz grade into the line of best fit.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">y = 1(65) + 2<br _ngcontent-oly-c313="">y = 65 + 2<br _ngcontent-oly-c313="">y =
                67</p>
            <p _ngcontent-oly-c313="">The expected Chemistry quiz grade would be a 67.</p>
