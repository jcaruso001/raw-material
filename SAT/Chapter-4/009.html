OK, maybe it is, but many of the common mistakes made by students on the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-oly-c363="">ACT</em>&nbsp;math tests are due to simple mistakes in operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More often than not, this is the result of rushing through an otherwise easy problem and arriving at one of the wrong answers. The test writers know what mistakes students commonly make, and they use this information when coming up with the wrong answer choices. This is where the “easy” problems get you.&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c363="">Remember to take your time so you won’t miss these questions!</strong></p><p _ngcontent-oly-c363="">Also,&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-oly-c363="">remember the all-important&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-oly-c363="">order of operations</em></strong>. (We’ll review this as well.) Just as for a surgeon, the order in which you do things when performing mathematical operations is vitally important. We’ll review some of the basics of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division here. If you feel that you need more help or practice with any of these, consult your math teacher. Your ability to perform basic mathematical operations will be extremely important to your success on the test. You will be able to use your calculator on this part of the test, but your understanding of the basic mathematical operations will help prevent careless mistakes. Also, some of the more advanced calculators are capable of performing many of the more advanced operations as well, such as multiplying and dividing complex numbers. Consult the manual for your calculator to find out what its capabilities are.</p></app-sat-operations-with-numbers><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----></div>
