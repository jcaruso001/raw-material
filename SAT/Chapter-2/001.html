        <h1 _ngcontent-oly-c265="">Chapter Two: Test-Taking Tips</h1>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c265="">The next two chapters will focus on the review of skills related to the areas tested
            on the SAT. Along with skill review, you will find tips and strategies for tackling specific types of
            questions. This chapter will center on general tips for taking standardized college entrance tests. While we
            cannot guarantee that these tips will work for every student, you should consider them as good advice for
            any test-taker.<br _ngcontent-oly-c265=""><br _ngcontent-oly-c265="">Nora, a student who recently took the
            SAT, offers the following advice:</p>
        <ul _ngcontent-oly-c265="">
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5"> Dress in layers and bring a sweater or jacket. <ul
                    _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5">
                    <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="">Test sites use the cafeteria, auditorium, or other spaces that are large
                        enough to hold all of the test-takers, but schools often turn off the heat or air conditioning
                        on the weekends. It is difficult to concentrate when you are too hot or too cold.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5"> Bring a watch. <ul _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5">
                    <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="">Basic time management is up to you! The proctors tell you how much time
                        you have for each section, when to start, when to stop, and when you have 5 minutes left. You
                        should pay attention to how long you are taking on the questions and pace yourself during the
                        test. Any watch or other device that can connect with the Web is prohibited.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5"> Skip hard questions or use your best guess. There is no wrong
                answer penalty on the SAT. Whenever you do not know how to answer a question, always guess! You can
                usually narrow your choices down to two possible correct answers. That will give you a 50% chance of
                answering the question correctly - we will cover guessing in more detail below. It is important not to
                leave any question unanswered! </li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5"> Replace, in your mind, long hard story character names, like
                Jedidiah, Beauregard, Shaneequa with Bill or Jane; alternatively, use the first letter of the name: “J,”
                “B,” “S.” <ul _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5">
                    <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="">You can get lost in the names and it can draw your attention away from
                        the question.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5"> Read carefully! <ul _ngcontent-oly-c265="">
                    <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5"> Make sure you understand the main idea of the passage. Ask
                        yourself these two questions: <ul _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5">
                            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="">1) What is the passage about -- the subject?</li>
                            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="">2) How does the subject of the passage relate to the questions?
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5"> Review the basic concepts <ul _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5">
                    <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="">Review arithmetic operations and their order in solving problems,
                        algebraic formulas, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5">Know how to solve word problems and how to apply basic formulas to
                them.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5">Know how to solve 2-D and 3-D shape problems Be sure you are
                comfortable solving problems involving circumference, perimeter, and area.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5">Be prepared for lots of questions using algebra. (Example: 2x = 4 or
                xy = 0).</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5">Be aware that a few questions may include seldom-used units of
                measurement, such as “stones.” Do not worry about the unit. Solve the problem as you would with any
                other problem.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5"> Bring a graphing calculator. <ul _ngcontent-oly-c265=""
                    class="mx-5">
                    <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="">It will help in converting decimals to fractions and vice versa, with
                        square root, etc., and will save a lot of time. Make sure the calculator works and you have
                        practiced with it prior to the test. It would be a good idea to bring fresh batteries and/or a
                        second calculator just in case your first calculator stops working.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 _ngcontent-oly-c265="">To Guess or Not to Guess?</h2>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c265="">In the new SAT format, there is NO penalty for incorrect answers. Answer ALL
            questions! However, when you can, eliminate at least one answer - eliminating two is even better! If you
            cannot eliminate any of the answer choices, always choose the same letter to guess for every problem on
            which you guess. This will improve your chances of selecting the correct answer.</p>
        <h2 _ngcontent-oly-c265="">Some Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c265="">In addition to Nora’s comments and our recommendations on guessing, other general
            test-taking advice includes the following:</p>
        <ul _ngcontent-oly-c265="" class="mx-5">
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="">Get a good night’s sleep before the test.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="">Eat a light breakfast.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="">Dress comfortably.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="">Bring several sharpened #2 pencils and a good eraser.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265=""> Arrive at the test site early or on time. <ul _ngcontent-oly-c265=""
                    class="mx-5">
                    <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="">(You will not be allowed to take the test if you are late!)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="">Bring a snack and something to drink for break times.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-oly-c265="">Familiarize yourself with the test directions before test day. The directions are
                always the same for each test and section so you will save some time by not having to read them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p _ngcontent-oly-c265="">By utilizing these tips and strategies along with those offered in Chapters 3 and 4,
            you will increase your chances for success in taking the SAT. So, jump right in, review the comments
