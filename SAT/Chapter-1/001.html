      <h2 _ngcontent-oly-c264="">What is the SAT?</h2>
      <p _ngcontent-oly-c264="">
        The SAT college entrance examinations, designed and developed by The
        Educational Testing Service (ETS) in Princeton, New Jersey, and
        administered by The College Board, are taken by more than 2 million
        people annually. There are two categories of this examination
        program—the SAT and the SAT Subject Tests.
      </p>
      <h2 _ngcontent-oly-c264="">SAT</h2>
      <p _ngcontent-oly-c264="">
        This exam assesses critical thinking abilities necessary for successful
        college level study. It is a 3 hour 50 minute test that utilizes verbal
        and mathematical questions to measure skill in critical reading,
        grammar/use of conventions, mathematical and science reasoning, and
        essay writing. The test is composed of four sections: Reading, Writing
        and Language, Math—No Calculator and Math—Calculator. An optional
        analytical essay can also be included. This essay should reflect skill
        in analyzing a text as well as demonstrate clear reasoning and proper
        use of standard language conventions and written structure. The chart
        below summarizes the contents of the SAT:

      <h2 _ngcontent-oly-c264="">SAT Subject Tests</h2>
      <p _ngcontent-oly-c264="">
        These tests are designed to allow students the opportunity to
        demonstrate their knowledge in specific areas of study. Formerly called
        the SAT II, the following Subject Tests are available: English,
        history/social studies, mathematics, science, and languages. Each
        Subject Test is a 1-hour multiple-choice examination, allowing students
        to take up to three tests on the same day. (For detailed information
        about the SAT Subject Tests, visit

      <h2 _ngcontent-oly-c264="">Who Should Take the SAT?</h2>
      <p _ngcontent-oly-c264="">
        As a college entrance examination, the SAT is taken largely by high
        school juniors and seniors. Most American colleges and universities
        accept the SAT, along with a record of academic performance (the high
        school transcript), evidence of involvement in extra- and co-curricular
        activities, recommendations, essays, and other supportive documents, as
        a part of the application profile of potential students.
      </p>
      <p _ngcontent-oly-c264="">
        Since the test measures mathematics through the third year of college
        preparatory study, we recommend that students take their first SAT no
        earlier than the spring of their junior year in high school, unless they
        are highly advanced in their academic work. The majority of colleges
        record their applicants’ SAT scores using the highest score achieved in
        each area of the test. Therefore, students who achieve a high score in
        one or two areas but feel the need to improve on scores in other areas
        should feel free to take the exam again, prior to their college
        application deadlines.
      </p>
      <h2 _ngcontent-oly-c264="">
        How do I register for the SAT and what fees apply?
      </h2>
      <p _ngcontent-oly-c264="">
        Test registration materials are available in your high school guidance
        or college counseling office. You will find test dates and registration
        deadlines posted in both of these locations as well.
      </p>
      <p _ngcontent-oly-c264="">
        You can also register online at www.collegeboard.org. There are many
        advantages to registering online, including the ability to confirm your
        registration, print your SAT test admission ticket, and receive or send
        your exam scores.
      </p>
      <p _ngcontent-oly-c264="">
        The fees for taking the SAT and the SAT Subject Tests are outlined in
        the registration materials or may be found online at
        www.collegeboard.org. Because additional fees may apply under various
        circumstances, it is wise to read the registration material carefully.
      </p>
      <p _ngcontent-oly-c264="">
        You may be eligible for a fee waiver to offset the costs related to SAT
        tests. This may also apply to college application fees at colleges that
        work in cooperation with the SAT Fee Waiver Service of The College
        Board. Fee waiver information is available through your guidance or
        college counselor, and fee waiver cards can be procured only from the
        counselor, even for online registration. Home-schooled students must
        provide the local high school proof of eligibility for fee waivers. To
        use the card, you must register for the SAT exams according to regularly
        posted deadlines.
