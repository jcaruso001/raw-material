            <p _ngcontent-fbe-c114=""> Never pay anyone for scholarship searches or scholarship money. If you are paying
                for scholarship money, that should serve as a warning that something is amiss. There are plenty of free
                databases available, such as those listed previously in this unit.

                    _ngcontent-fbe-c114=""></strong></p>
            <p _ngcontent-fbe-c114=""> Be sure to take advantage of possible funding available in your community. Don’t
                rule out your local organizations such as PTA’s, Lions Clubs, VFA, community foundations, and other
                groups. The applicant pool for this funding will be smaller, and it will be easier to win a scholarship
                than it will be when competing for scholarships from a large national organization. The
                scholarship/grant award amounts may not be as significant, perhaps $1,000 or less – but they add up!
            </p>
            <p _ngcontent-fbe-c114=""> For a clear understanding of how to “think small”, look at the following website;

            <p _ngcontent-fbe-c114=""> Start applying for scholarships early. Most scholarships have specific timeframes
                for applying. For assistance with scheduling, see our <a _ngcontent-fbe-c114="">Student Planning

            <p _ngcontent-fbe-c114=""> From your freshman year of college continuing through graduate school, people are
                willing to help you pay for school so that they can get professionals on the backside of that college
