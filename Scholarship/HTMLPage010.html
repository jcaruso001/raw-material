            <p _ngcontent-jvd-c117=""><strong _ngcontent-jvd-c117="">Be Involved</strong></p>
            <p _ngcontent-jvd-c117=""> Involvement is the key to both scholarships and entry into college. Seek out
                opportunities to lead, volunteer,&nbsp;or participate in every endeavor. Some high schools require
                volunteer hours for graduation, and documented volunteer/service hours are also sometimes required for
                scholarship eligibility.&nbsp;Add&nbsp;volunteering&nbsp;to your college planning&nbsp;so you avoid
                having to accomplish&nbsp;service&nbsp;hours near the end of your high school tenure. (See the College
                Planning Guide section&nbsp;for details). <strong _ngcontent-jvd-c117=""><a _ngcontent-jvd-c117="">Click
                        here for the Student Planning Guide</a></strong></p>
            <p _ngcontent-jvd-c117=""><strong _ngcontent-jvd-c117="">Know Your Data</strong></p>
            <p _ngcontent-jvd-c117=""> For the most part, scholarship applications are generic.&nbsp;In other
                words,&nbsp;once&nbsp;you have the standard data required for one scholarship, you have the data for
                many. Acquire documentation from your school such as GPA, SAT/ACT scores, class ranking, list of
                extracurricular activities, letters of recommendation, etc. in order
                to&nbsp;complete&nbsp;applications. &nbsp;
            </p>
            <p _ngcontent-jvd-c117=""><strong _ngcontent-jvd-c117="">Know Your Interests</strong></p>
            <p _ngcontent-jvd-c117=""> Consider what you want to pursue in college, your favorite
                activities&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;interests, then search according to your list. Being awarded a few small
                scholarships can really add up.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p _ngcontent-jvd-c117=""><strong _ngcontent-jvd-c117="">Establish Routines</strong></p>
            <p _ngcontent-jvd-c117=""> Set aside one or two hours per week to work on the scholarship process. &nbsp;
            </p>
            <p _ngcontent-jvd-c117=""><strong _ngcontent-jvd-c117="">Be Organized</strong></p>
            <p _ngcontent-jvd-c117=""> Bookmark the websites you have searched. Create a spreadsheet of scholarships you
                are applying to (website, deadline, type of scholarship,&nbsp;etc). Keep this information throughout
                college as you can continue applying for scholarships&nbsp;during those years.
