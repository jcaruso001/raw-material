        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c38="">Consider reduced or limited meal plans. Carefully think about your eating habits . You&nbsp;do not&nbsp;have to sign up for the standard “3 meals per day, 7 days per week”...especially if you know you are NOT a breakfast person or that you will be traveling home every other weekend.&nbsp;But also realize, eating out can be expensive. Will you have access to a kitchen&nbsp;or a small&nbsp;refrigerator&nbsp;and microwave in your room?&nbsp;</p>
