        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c40="">Consider&nbsp;part-time work&nbsp;during your college years. Search&nbsp;for jobs associated with your&nbsp;academic major.&nbsp;For example, if you are majoring in nursing, a job in a hospital or medical office would be a great fit and give you lots of experience in your field. Make sure to keep your priorities in check and only work the number of hours that allow you to maintain good grades and complete the required coursework to&nbsp;graduate. &nbsp;</p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c40="">After college,&nbsp;the job market is&nbsp;very competitive,&nbsp;so&nbsp;you will need to build your&nbsp;work&nbsp;resume during college. Working a part-time job job demonstrates reliability,&nbsp;time management skills,&nbsp;responsibility,&nbsp;and&nbsp;an&nbsp;aptitude for the discipline in which you are studying.&nbsp;</p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c40="">Caution: You will need to weigh the pros and cons of off-campus vs on campus-jobs as well as the number of hours you work.&nbsp;</p>
