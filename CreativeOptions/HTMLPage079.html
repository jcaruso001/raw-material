        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c39="">Carefully review your parents’ medical insurance policy for price and coverage. Then compare it with the coverage offered by the college. Often, the college’s will be higher. If you choose to continue your parents’ coverage, make sure you can stay on the policy until you are no longer a full-time student.</p>
