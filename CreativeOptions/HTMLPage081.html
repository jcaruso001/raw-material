        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c42="">One creative option&nbsp;is buying a small home or condominium close to a college campus. Many parents,&nbsp;or students returning to college, become property owners. It may be an investment that can save thousands in dorm and living costs. Also, by having roommates&nbsp;who pay rent, you can offset many of the monthly expenses such as the mortgage and utilities.&nbsp;Lastly, properties&nbsp;near&nbsp;college campuses usually maintain&nbsp;or increase&nbsp;in&nbsp;value.&nbsp;</p>
