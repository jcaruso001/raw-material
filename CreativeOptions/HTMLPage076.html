        <h2 _ngcontent-mqv-c34="">Dual Enrollment Options in High School</h2>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c34="">Dual Enrollment&nbsp;programs allow eligible high school students to enroll in college coursework creditable toward both high school diploma requirements and some&nbsp;core&nbsp;college credits. This enables the student to shorten the time needed to complete college, broaden the scope of academic options available to them, and increase the depth of study. &nbsp;Check with your high school&nbsp;guidance&nbsp;counselor for enrollment eligibility requirements such as your current high school GPA and qualifying test scores.</p>
