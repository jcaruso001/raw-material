        <h2 _ngcontent-mqv-c43="">Shorten your Time in College</h2>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c43="">The average college graduate takes 5-1/2 years to get a 4-year degree. Decide now to earn your college degree in 4 years. Shortening your time in college will save you a tremendous amount of money. One year of&nbsp;college (tuition,&nbsp;room,&nbsp;board, travel,&nbsp;etc.)&nbsp;could&nbsp;cost $20,000- $40,000&nbsp;easily,&nbsp;so&nbsp;graduating in&nbsp;4 years can save you&nbsp;a lot in the long run.</p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c43="">How do you shorten your time in college? &nbsp;</p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c43="">Consider taking classes instead of taking a break during your off&nbsp;semesters (Winter, Summer breaks). &nbsp;</p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c43="">If you are enrolled in a 4-year college,&nbsp;check out schools near you such as a community college for more classes during the summer or on weekends when students would not normally be in class. Taking online classes during this time is also a great option. &nbsp;</p>
