                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c129=""> When writing effective essays, it is important to remember to use proper
                    writing habits. You do not write as you speak. <ul _ngcontent-pfn-c129="" class="mx-5">
                        <li _ngcontent-pfn-c129="">The use of language and vocabulary is important.</li>
                        <li _ngcontent-pfn-c129="">Do NOT use contractions in your essays.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c129=""> Grammar and spelling are especially important when writing essays. Some
                    colleges and potential job or internship opportunities may notice grammar and/or spelling errors and
                    decide to immediately move on to the next candidate without further review of the student’s
                    application. </li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c129=""> Proofreading is the key to successful essays! Always read over what you have
                    written and read it out loud. You will catch more errors doing this. It is extremely important to
                    have someone proofread your essay. </li>

                them down to identify errors. Using one of your old essays as an example, write the thesis, the main
                points of the essay, and the conclusion to learn how to identify these aspects of an essay.

                    remember that this choice will be binding and if accepted, you will not be allowed to apply to other
                    schools. Think it through wisely. </li>
