                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c132=""> Understand that more students are applying for college than ever before;
                    there is greater competition. It is possible to have a great ACT/SAT score and be very involved just
                    like the next person, but if that other student also has a high ACT/SAT score and an even higher
                    GPA, the other student’s chances are higher at getting into the college of their choice. Therefore,
                    it is critical that you stay on top of your coursework and remain involved all through high school.
                </li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c132=""> Plan visits to the last of your top schools if you have not already done so.
                    Consider visiting backups as well. </li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c132=""> Research and become familiar with college admissions requirements for these
                    schools. For example: <ul _ngcontent-pfn-c132="" class="mx-5">
                        <li _ngcontent-pfn-c132=""> Determine the specific requirements for the essay (if required), if
                            they require a personal interview, etc. </li>
                        <li _ngcontent-pfn-c132=""> Discover test score and GPA minimum requirements for your top
                            schools </li>
                        <li _ngcontent-pfn-c132="">Research which schools accept the common application</li>
                        <li _ngcontent-pfn-c132="">Look up the application fees for your top schools</li>

                </li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c132=""> Know what the common application is and how to complete it. More and more
                    colleges use the common application. However, be aware that essay requirements and questions will be
                    different for each school. </li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c132=""> Be able to support and defend your rationale for your choice of courses and
