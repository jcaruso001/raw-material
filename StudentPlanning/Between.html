        <h2 _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">Between Junior and Senior Year: July</h2>
        <p _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">Briefly review “What Next?” from May/June.</p>
        <p _ngcontent-vpm-c130=""><strong _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">General Rules for&nbsp;<em
                    _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">College Success</em>&nbsp;to Practice your Senior Year</strong></p>
        <ul _ngcontent-vpm-c130="" class="mx-5">
            <li _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">Get and stay organized!!! This is important to do while in high school to prepare
                you for the organization you will need once in college.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-vpm-c130=""> Ways to seek out good study locations. <ul _ngcontent-vpm-c130="" class="mx-5">
                    <li _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">Practice this now, before you begin sharing a dorm room in a year’s time.
                    </li>
                    <li _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">If you have trouble concentrating with noise, start practicing reading
                        and focusing with music on. Or, if you easily fall asleep when it is silent, turn on music.
                        Continue to practice repeatedly until you can accomplish new ways to study.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li _ngcontent-vpm-c130=""> Sit in the front during classes. <ul _ngcontent-vpm-c130="" class="mx-5">
                    <li _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">Once in college, especially if you attend a large school, it is important
                        to be seen and heard by your professor. You will be asking your teachers for recommendation
                        letters for various reasons - establishing a solid relationship with your professors will help
                        you in the long run for multiple reasons.</li>
                    <li _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">Write down, keep track and update your goals.</li>
                    <li _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">Goals are very important. You do not want to get into college and lose
                        sight of the end-goal you had while in high school because you partied too much, met a new group
                        of friends, or took on too many responsibilities. Keep your goals visible.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p _ngcontent-vpm-c130=""><br _ngcontent-vpm-c130=""><strong
                _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">ACTIVITY:</strong>&nbsp;Discuss all the above topics with your parents and/or
            counselor, determine which of these you are already doing, and determine the effectiveness. If you are
            lacking in any of the above, discuss how to improve these rules to success for yourself. Make a plan!</p>
        <p _ngcontent-vpm-c130=""><strong _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">What Next?</strong>&nbsp;If you have not already
            invested in a day planner, do so now! This will help you on your road to success and organization.</p>
        <p _ngcontent-vpm-c130=""><strong _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">Staying on Track...</strong></p>
        <ul _ngcontent-vpm-c130="" class="mx-5">
            <li _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">Attend local and regional college fairs, especially if your top schools will be
                at these events</li>
            <li _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">If you plan to take the ACT or the SAT this fall, remember to check the website
                for the registration deadline and sign-up at least a month in advance.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">Search and apply for scholarships that are due within the next month.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-vpm-c130="">Prepare yourself for entering into your final year of high school; this is not
                the time to relax. In fact, it is just about to get a little crazier, which is a good thing! It means
                that your dreams of college are quickly approaching!</li>
