                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c149="">Time Management - the day of the interview is an important day to ensure that
                    you are on time. This is not the day to be late if that is common for you, or to try an unknown
                    “shortcut” to the interview, or to grab a bite to eat on the way. First impressions are important,
                    and it is not wise to be running behind for that first impression. Arriving 10 minutes early is
                    considered on time.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c149="">Importance of proper language skills - in an ever-changing English
                    vocabulary, slang and acronyms are increasingly popular; however, proper grammar, sentence
                    structure, and appropriate language are required to make a good impression on your potential
                    employer.</li>
