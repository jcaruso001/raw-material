                    Athletic Recruiting” guide. You should also begin reviewing this guide for future references

                        <li _ngcontent-pfn-c151="">If the college you are interested in is local, find out about events
                            you may be able to attend on campus to become more familiar with the campus and students;
                            including concerts, plays, games, etc.</li>

            <ul _ngcontent-pfn-c151="" class="mx-5">
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c151="">Once you begin receiving information from colleges, organize it in a way that
                    it is easy to access, and keep it handy. You might use shelves, a binder with pockets, a file
                    drawer, or scan docs into computer files.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c151="">If using a binder, it should be a three-ring binder, which will hold
                    important information about particular schools of interest and what they offer. Label it in a way
                    that makes sense to you- either by college, or by sections titled “campus expenses,” “campus
                    involvement opportunities,” etc. You can create anything that will be easily accessed, followed, and
                    understood by you!</li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c151="">As you receive college information, create a pro/con list of the
                    characteristics of each school such as the size, financial aid options, housing, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p _ngcontent-pfn-c151=""><strong _ngcontent-pfn-c151="">Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Include your 4-year plan and
                checklist in the binder to keep you on track.</p>
