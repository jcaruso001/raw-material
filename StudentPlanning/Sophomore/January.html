                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c148="">Volunteer in the community. Many college organizations volunteer in the
                    community, and with previous experience you may be more eligible than others for leadership or
                    organizational roles.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c148=""> Consider joining a civic group, club, or professional organization in your
                    area of interest. <ul _ngcontent-pfn-c148="" class="mx-5">
                        <li _ngcontent-pfn-c148="">Most organizations and clubs in communities offer a “student”
                            membership status or discount. This allows more involvement in the community and more to add
                            to your college resume.</li>
                        <li _ngcontent-pfn-c148="">Many area organizations have branches in other locations. Check the
                            college or the cities of the colleges you are interested in to see whether they have these
                            organizations. If so, you will have had previous experience with these groups in your
                            hometown so you can quickly become involved in your new community.</li>

                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c148=""> Consider options of how to shorten your time in college. <ul

                        <li _ngcontent-pfn-c148="">Shortening the amount of time you spend in college helps cut expenses
                            tremendously.</li>
                        <li _ngcontent-pfn-c148="">If you take dual-credit or AP classes that allow you to take credit
                            hours to college with you, you may already have enough credits to knock out an entire
                            semester's or year's worth of work, potentially allowing you to graduate early.</li>
