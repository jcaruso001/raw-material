              <li _ngcontent-pfn-c146="">
                Most colleges prefer a full load of Foreign Language, English,
                History, Science, and Math each year of high school.

                Though the PSAT is not a test score that will be considered by
                colleges, the test is based on and organized like the real ACT
                and SAT and provides excellent practice for the actual test you
                will take in your junior year.
