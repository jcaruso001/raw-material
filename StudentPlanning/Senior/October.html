                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c144="">Understand that more students are applying to college than ever before; the
                    competition is great. You can have a great ACT/SAT score and be very involved just like the next
                    person, but if that other student also has a high ACT/SAT score and an even higher GPA than you did,
                    his or her chances are higher at getting into the college of their choice. You must work hard and
                    stay focused to blow away the competition.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c144="">Visit the last of your top schools if you have not already done so. Also
                    consider visits to backup schools as well.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c144=""> Research and familiarize yourself with what colleges require. <ul

                        <li _ngcontent-pfn-c144="">Is an essay required? What is the required length of the essay(s)?
                            Does the college require personal interviews?</li>
                        <li _ngcontent-pfn-c144="">Discover what test score and GPA minimums are for your top schools

                        <li _ngcontent-pfn-c144="">Be sure that you send your official transcripts and references;
                            neither can have a broken seal on the envelope. You may be required to send electronic
                            copies of your transcript which will require notifying your high school counselor.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c144="">Look into filling out the common application. More and more colleges are
                    using the common application. This will make the application process shorter as you will not have to
                    fill out basic information multiple times; however, most schools have separate essay requirements.
                </li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c144="">Be able to support and defend your rationale for your choice of
                    courses/electives and activities in high school in case admission staff ask you these types of
                    questions.</li>

            <p _ngcontent-pfn-c144=""><strong _ngcontent-pfn-c144="">ACTIVITY:</strong>&nbsp;Review your list of schools
                and select one or more to complete the application. Many students prefer to pick a reach school (one you
                think you may have difficulty in being admitted), a school you feel reasonably certain about admission,
                and a “fallback” school, one you will most certainly be granted admission.</p>

                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c144="">Research the admission requirements of your top schools; again, looking at
                    score and GPA minimums, as well as whether they accept the common application.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c144="">Check to see when your top school deadlines fall.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c144="">Make a checklist for each school you are applying to in order to be fully
                    sure you are getting in all the proper information to each.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c144="">Be sure to make copies of all your important documents such as your driver’s
                    license. You may need to send in or upload copies of these.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-pfn-c144="">Prepare your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as soon as the
                    form is available (usually October 1).</li>
