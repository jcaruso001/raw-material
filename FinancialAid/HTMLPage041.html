        <h2 _ngcontent-mqv-c53="">Why I need Financial Support:</h2>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c53="">When creating a budget for your college years,&nbsp;know that&nbsp;published costs generally include a broad range as students' spending habits vary wildly. So,&nbsp;as you review these numbers&nbsp;think about how you spend money, what your monthly income will be, and what you believe you can afford.&nbsp;</p>

            <strong _ngcontent-mqv-c53="">The&nbsp;Surprise&nbsp;Costs:&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c53="">While some costs included on the list below might be considered “standard costs”, there are the smaller, “oh, I forgot about those” costs within the larger category that&nbsp;can&nbsp;bust your budget.&nbsp;</p>
        <ul _ngcontent-mqv-c53="">
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c53="">Books and supplies can run anywhere from $500-$1,500 per&nbsp;year depending on your course of study. While you may have calculated one book per class, there may&nbsp;actually be&nbsp;3&nbsp;or&nbsp;4&nbsp;books required&nbsp;depending on what course you are taking.&nbsp;(algebra may use one large book and a literature course may&nbsp;use 4&nbsp;or&nbsp;5&nbsp;novels)&nbsp;</li>
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c53="">Transportation&nbsp;costs can sneak up on you. Do you live on or off campus? Do you have a part time job off campus? And, what about those trips home?&nbsp;Think car insurance, gas, car maintenance, parking fees, airplane/bus tickets.&nbsp;</li>
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c53="">If you choose to live off campus, don’t forget about the utilities that may not be included in rent – water, electricity, internet,&nbsp;food, furniture for the house/apartment,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;</li>
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c53="">Personal expenses (haircuts, coffee, toiletries, laundry,&nbsp;eating out,&nbsp;college gear, attending games,&nbsp;etc.)&nbsp;cost approximately&nbsp;$1,000-$1,500&nbsp;per&nbsp;year</li>
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c53="">Fees/dues&nbsp;(technology, parking, labs, sports, student affairs, Greek life) can run from $1,000-$1,500&nbsp;per&nbsp;year. &nbsp;</li>
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c53="">Study abroad, workshops, conventions are very important learning tools for many colleges. That could mean traveling overseas for studying or to local cities for classes that&nbsp;could&nbsp;increase your cost of college from $1,500-$3,000&nbsp;per&nbsp;year &nbsp;</li>
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c53="">Technology/computers are required for almost every course and can cost anywhere between $500-$2,000.&nbsp;And,&nbsp;don’t forget maintenance or software update costs.&nbsp;</li>
