            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c63="" class="mt-5">The Army, Navy, and Marine Corps each provide tuition assistance (a
                "kicker") in addition to what you earn through the GI Bill. Each service controls the amount of extra
                money it provides. The Army fund increases the amount of support to as much as $70,000; the Navy fund
                increases the amount of support to as much as $50,000, and the Marine Corps fund increases the amount of
                support also to as much as $50,000. College Funds are awarded on a competitive basis according to
                academic merit (i.e., scoring in the top half of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery). To
                qualify one must also agree to serve six years.</p>
