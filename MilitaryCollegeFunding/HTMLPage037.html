                It is not for everyone. It is not for everyone because it is hard to do. If you understand it, have a
                desire for it, and the capability for it, I challenge you to step to the plate. It is great life and a
                great career. Please look at some of the information we have provided. Look at some of the websites that
                were outlined and consider the military as a possible career jump-start or a viable way for you to
                finance your college education. <br _ngcontent-bxx-c62=""><br _ngcontent-bxx-c62=""></p><app-quiz
