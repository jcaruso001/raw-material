          Military Service is a career and it is a profession. It is a calling.
          It is not for everyone. It is not for everyone because it is hard to
          do. If you understand it, have a desire for it, and the capability for
          it, I challenge you to step to the plate. It is great life and a great
          career. Please look at some of the information we have provided. Look
          at some of the websites that were outlined and consider the military
          as a possible career jump-start or a viable way for you to finance
          your college education. <br _ngcontent-bxx-c62="" /><br
