            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c64="" class="mt-5">There are a couple of enlistment options that may be in your best
                interest when considering joining the military, as a means of financing college or as a career. Those
                options are the Delayed Enlistment Program (DEP) and the Split Training Option. </p>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c64="">The Delayed Enlistment Program (sometimes called the Delayed Entry Program) is also
                called the Future Soldiers Program in the Army. Individuals going on to active duty, enlist first into
                the DEP. This is an actual enlistment into the inactive reserves, with an agreement to report for active
                duty (to ship out to boot camp) at a specific time in the future. Under current regulations, one can
                remain in the DEP for up to 365 days. This option can ensure that the skilled slot you want will be held
                for you. </p>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c64="">The Split Training Option lets you join the National Guard while you are still in
                high school. </p>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c64="">Here’s how it works: You enlist while you’re still a junior (you must be 17 years
                old to enlist and have permission from a parent or guardian), finish that year and attend Basic Combat
                Training during the summer between your junior and senior years. You will return to school for your
                senior year, during which you will train one weekend a month with your local unit (and of course get
                paid!). The summer following graduation from high school, you will attend Advanced Individual Training
                (AIT) and train for your Guard job (your MOS or military occupation specialty). In most cases, you
                should be home in time to start college in the fall. It is a great way to start serving and a great
                part-time job during school. This program may vary among the Services. Your recruiter will have complete
                details. </p>
