        <p _ngcontent-bxx-c73="" class="mt-5">United State Reserves and National Guard. What they are – Weekend and
            summer job opportunities that have the best college financing options available today. Citizen soldiers,
            federal Reserve and state National Guard agencies provide specific skills, training, and college financing
            options for virtually every college in the nation. They are not full-time military. In the event of a
            national emergency, reserve and national guard forces can be activated and deployed to support and augment
            active duty forces, which is a factor to consider.</p>
        <p _ngcontent-bxx-c73="">All have developed financing options that off-set or completely pay for college
            expenses. These include tuition assistance, fee-waivers, GI Bill options, bonus pay programs, loan
            re-payment programs, and part-time work positions. </p><a _ngcontent-bxx-c73="" target="_blank"
