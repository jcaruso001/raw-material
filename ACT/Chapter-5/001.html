            <h2 _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">Chapter Five: Science Skills Review</h2>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">The key point to understand about the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">ACT Science
                    Test</em>&nbsp;is that you are not being tested on your knowledge of science or scientific concepts,
                but rather on your ability to read and/or interpret graphs or data accompanying text. The questions can
                be answered from the information provided in the passage.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">The&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">ACT Science Test</em>&nbsp;requires many of
                the same skills that the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">ACT Reading Test</em>&nbsp;does. Just like
                interpreting a reading passage, you will have to “read” through graphs, charts and scientific data in
                order to discover and understand the main idea of a passage.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">On the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">Science Test</em>, there are usually three
                passages that present scientific data in the form of charts or graphs (Data Representation), three
                passages based on specific scientific experiments (Research Summaries), and one passage in which two or
                more scientists state opposing views on the same issue (Conflicting Views). This may vary according to
                your particular test. Accompanying each passage will be five to seven questions. Some passages will be
                very hard to understand, but concentrating on data will still enable you to answer many questions.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">The questions in the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">Science Test</em>&nbsp;fall
                into three general categories:</p>
            <ul _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c257=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">Understanding</strong>&nbsp;These questions
                    ask you to basically reiterate parts of the passage. This could include looking up a value on a
                    graph or explaining the underlying assumption behind the passage. The key to this type of question
                    is familiarizing yourself with the passage. Recognize where in the passage the question is directing
                    you for the answer. If you are misdirected, which does sometimes happen, look somewhere else. (This
                    is a good reminder for the Reading section also.)</li>
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c257=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">Analysis</strong>&nbsp;To answer these
                    questions, you’ll need a deeper understanding of the information in the passage. You’ll be expected
                    to recognize relationships and trends in the data. You may be asked to synthesize information from
                    different parts of the passage (or from different graphics) in order to generate a prediction or an
                    explanation.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c257=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">Generalization</strong>&nbsp;These questions
                    expect you to put things into perspective (the so-called “big picture”). You may be asked about
                    things not described in the passage, or you might be given new experimental conditions such that you
                    must predict the outcome. A question on the impact of the result is also entirely possible. You must
                    also be ready to answer questions that reference your knowledge of the world and do not necessarily
                    have the answers in the text or graphics.</li>
            </ul>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c257=""><br _ngcontent-cxv-c257=""><br _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">Here is an outline of the
                steps necessary to answer any question on the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">Science Test</em>.</p>
            <ol _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c257=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">Read the passage and underline key pieces of
                        information as you read.</strong>&nbsp;All the answers to the question will either be found in
                    the passage or can be interpreted from the data in the passage or your knowledge of the world. The
                    key points you should underline will most likely represent answers to one or more of the questions
                    being asked. In other words, determine what is being represented and identify the main idea of the
                    passage.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c257=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">Skim through the questions and choose the
                        easiest questions to answer first.</strong>&nbsp;The hardest part about the Science Test is that
                    it is a timed exam. In order to pace yourself for this test, knocking out the easiest and least
                    time-consuming questions first will enable you to focus on the tougher questions that require deeper
                    understanding. Usually, the first two or three questions are easier than the last two or three.
                    Don’t waste time struggling with a hard question until you’ve answered all the easy ones. You get
                    the same number of points for both, so focus on the “sure things” first.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c257=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">Always use the process of
                        elimination.</strong>&nbsp;Some answer choices are blatantly wrong. When you come across these,
                    cross them off and focus on the remaining choices. This will help you narrow things down so you can
                    focus on the potential correct answer.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c257=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">Always refer back to the passage to
                        double-check yourself.</strong>&nbsp;After you make an answer choice, go back to the passage
                    and/or graphic representation to make sure your choice agrees with the details within the passage or
                    graphic. If it doesn’t agree, eliminate that choice, pick another one, and then double-check
                    yourself again.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c257=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">When in doubt, use your best
                        guess.</strong>&nbsp;As explained earlier, if you’re stuck, make an “educated” guess. Eliminate
                    choices that are obviously wrong, and then take a guess. Your odds will have increased greatly by
                    eliminating one or two choices.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c257=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">Remember, your goal is to get
                        points.</strong>&nbsp;If a question is taking too long or is too difficult, leave it and come
                    back to it. Make sure you get all the easy points first.</li>
            </ol>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c257="">In order for you to fully understand the nature of the Science section, you will
                need to be able to recognize, read or interpret, and understand the different types of questions. Below,
                you will find some examples and explanations of each of the three types of passages.</p>
