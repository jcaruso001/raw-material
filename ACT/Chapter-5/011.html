The use of oil is projected to peak about 2007, and the supply is then projected to be extremely limited in 40–50 years. Alternative liquid fuels from various sources have been sought for years. The energy balance of ethanol is found by taking the amount of energy contained in a gallon of ethanol (roughly 76,000 Btu) and subtracting the amount of energy that goes into producing a gallon of ethanol.<br _ngcontent-cxv-c249=""><br _ngcontent-cxv-c249=""><em _ngcontent-cxv-c249=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c249="">Scientist 1</strong></em><br _ngcontent-cxv-c249=""><br _ngcontent-cxv-c249="">Energy outputs from ethanol produced using corn, switchgrass, and wood biomass were each less than the respective fossil energy inputs. The same was true for producing biodiesel using soybeans and sunflowers; however, the energy cost for producing soybean biodiesel was only slightly negative compared with ethanol production. Several physical and chemical factors limit the production of liquid fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel using plant biomass materials. These include the following:</p><ul _ngcontent-cxv-c249=""><li _ngcontent-cxv-c249="">An extremely low fraction of the sunlight reaching America is captured by plants. On aver- age, the sunlight captured by plants is only about 0.1%, with corn providing 0.25%. These low values are in contrast to photovoltaics that capture from 10% or more sunlight, or approximately 100-fold more sunlight than plant biomass.</li><li _ngcontent-cxv-c249="">In ethanol production, the carbohydrates are converted into ethanol by microbes that, on average, bring the concentration of ethanol to 8% in the broth with 92% water. Large amounts of fossil energy are required to remove the 8% ethanol from the 92% water.</li><li _ngcontent-cxv-c249="">For biodiesel production, there are two problems: the relatively low yields of oil crops, ranging from 1,500 kg/ha for sunflower to about 2,700 kg/ha for soybeans; sunflowers average 25.5% oil, whereas soybeans average 18% oil. In addition, the oil extraction processes for all oil crops is highly energy intensive as reported in this manuscript.</li><li _ngcontent-cxv-c249="">Therefore, these crops are poor producers of biomass energy.</li></ul><p _ngcontent-cxv-c249=""><br _ngcontent-cxv-c249=""><em _ngcontent-cxv-c249=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c249="">Scientist 2</strong></em><br _ngcontent-cxv-c249=""><br _ngcontent-cxv-c249="">The energy balance of ethanol is 1.34:1, which means that ethanol yields 34% more energy than it takes to produce it, including growing the corn, harvesting it, and distilling it into ethanol. The positive ratio is due mostly to technological advances in the ethanol production process. Advances in the areas most critical in determining the net energy value (NEV): corn yields, changes in agricultural practices resulting in reduced energy inputs, and advances in the corn- to-ethanol conversion process. Corn yield plays a critical role in determining the energy balance of starch-based ethanol. In fact, a 1% increase in corn yield raises NEV by 0.37 percent. Importantly, with the exception of a few bad years, corn yields have been increasing over time since 1975. Ethanol plants are the largest fossil energy–consuming component in the corn-to- ethanol fuel cycle. Today’s ethanol plants use far less energy than in the past. The majority of ethanol plants in production today have been extensively modernized, utilizing the latest advances in ethanol production technology. Fertilizer accounts for about 45% of the energy required to grow corn. However, the use of fertilizer in grain production, which includes chemical inputs such as nitrogen, potash, and phosphate, has been in general decline since the early 1980s. Furthermore, biodiesel yields 3.2 units of fuel product energy for every unit of fossil energy consumed in its life cycle; in other words, the biodiesel life cycle produces more than three times the energy in its final fuel product than it uses in fossil energy. The production process of biodiesel and diesel is practically the same in terms of efficiency in the conversion of raw materials into fuel. The difference is that biodiesel is able to use renewable resources in its production – soybeans and rapeseed oils, or used frying oil and unwanted animal fats – while conventional diesel relies on fossil fuel resources. In fact, petroleum diesel’s life cycle yields only 0.83 units of fuel product per unit of fossil energy consumed.<br _ngcontent-cxv-c249=""><br _ngcontent-cxv-c249="">1.

The answer is C. Scientist 1’s argument centers around biomass being poor compared to oil.<br _ngcontent-cxv-c249=""><br _ngcontent-cxv-c249="">2. The answer is H. The statement about photovoltaics is the only statement that does not correspond with Scientist 2’s argument.

If all the data used by Scientist 1 were out of date, then his argument would be outdated. This would be the most damaging argument because the old data cannot be used to argue against the new data (for the argument to be valid, both scientists must have concurrent data).</p></app-conflicting-viewpoints><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----></div>
