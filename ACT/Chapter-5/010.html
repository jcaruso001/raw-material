You don’t have to know much science in order to attack these passages, but you are expected to understand how scientists go about getting and testing knowledge. This process is known as the&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">scientific method</strong>.</p><p _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">The scientific method is the “tool” that scientists use to find the answers to questions. It is the process of thinking through the possible solutions to a problem and testing each possibility to find the best solution. The scientific method involves the following steps: identifying the problem, stating a hypothesis or asking a question, establishing variables and experimental design, conducting project experimentation, analyzing data, and reaching a conclusion.</p><p _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">Experimental design is often a subject of questions in research summaries. Make sure you understand the variables involved in the experiment and how they relate to each other. You may also be questioned about the validity of results based on how the experiment was set up or conducted.</p><p _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">To succeed on the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">ACT Science Test</em>, you must learn to understand how scientists think. In your science classes in school, your teachers normally explain general rules of science to you and then expect you to apply these rules to solve problems. This is considered specific thinking (solving a problem with a known rule of science). Some questions on the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">Science Test</em>&nbsp;are based on this type of thinking; however, the majority of questions will test your ability to see the kinds of patterns in specific data that you must use to formulate your own general hypotheses, conclusions, or questions.</p><p _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">On the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">Science Test</em>, you will be expected to understand how the experiments in a Research Summary passage are designed. You should jot down brief notes on each experiment as you read it. These notes should highlight the differences between each experiment. The notes will often refer to a procedure in the experiment. This is important because by noting the difference between the experiments, you will be able to quickly gauge to which experiment a question is referring.</p><p _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">You may also be asked to identify the control of the study (if one exists). A control is the baseline for comparison. The control is normally the independent system without adding or changing any variables.</p><p _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">A well-designed experiment involves:</p><ul _ngcontent-cxv-c255=""><li _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">A control group</li><li _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">A single variable that changes from test to test</li><li _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">Other variables that remain the same from test to test</li></ul><p _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">Carefully read the introductory paragraph. This paragraph often contains some small bit of information which you will need to answer a question. Read Experiment 1 and answer all questions pertaining to experiment 1. Do the same for Experiment 2 (and others if there are more than 2 experiments). Answer questions that compare the experiments last.</p><p _ngcontent-cxv-c255=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">Sample Research Summary Passage</strong></p><p _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">Heat changes the properties of water. If we add enough heat to water in its solid form (ice), it will change its state of matter to a liquid. We call this melting. If more heat is added, the liquid will change to gas (water vapor). When enough water vapor forms so that the pressure of the vapor is equal to the pressure of the atmosphere above the water, the vapor can then push the air above the container away and allow vapor bubbles to be released. We call this boiling.</p><p _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">Test 1<br _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">At an altitude of 1000 feet, a beaker was filled about half full with distilled water. The beaker of water was then heated until the distilled water began to boil. A thermometer was suspended in the water to measure the temperature. The temperature observed was 210 °F.</p><p _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">Test 2<br _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">The experiment was repeated at an altitude of 800 feet, and the temperature was observed to be 212 °F.</p><p _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">Test 3<br _ngcontent-cxv-c255="">The experiment was repeated at an altitude of 4000 feet, and the observed temperature was 204 °F.</p><div _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" class="quiz"><div _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" class="qa"><div _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" class="questions"></div><div _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" class="answers"><div _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" class="answer"><input _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" type="radio" name="answer" value="" id="answerOne"><label _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" for="answerOne"></label></div><div _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" class="answer"><input _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" type="radio" name="answer" value="" id="answerTwo"><label _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" for="answerTwo"></label></div><div _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" class="answer"><input _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" type="radio" name="answer" value="" id="answerThree"><label _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" for="answerThree"></label></div><div _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" class="answer"><input _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" type="radio" name="answer" value="" id="answerFour"><label _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" for="answerFour"></label></div></div></div><div _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" class="response"></div><button _ngcontent-cxv-c255="" id="next">Next</button></div></app-research-summaries><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----></div>
