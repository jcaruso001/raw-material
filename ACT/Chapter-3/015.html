    "question": "We visited a local animal shelter on Saturday. We wanted to pick out a new dog. As we walked through the corridor, each dog had its own way of sharing something about its personality. Some dogs barked, others jumped up and down, and still others cowered in the corners of their cages. We visited with several different dogs, but the one who stole our hearts was Bogart. This big, black dog with droopy ears and a wagging tail is now the newest member of our family. What is the best way to combine the first two sentences of this paragraph ?",
