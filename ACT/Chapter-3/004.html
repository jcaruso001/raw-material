        <h2 _ngcontent-bxx-c159="">Active/Passive Voice</h2>
        <ul _ngcontent-bxx-c159="">
            <li _ngcontent-bxx-c159="">Although passive voice is not grammatically incorrect, it is often considered to
                be stylistically unpleasant. The&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c159="">ACT</em>&nbsp;prefers the use of the
                active voice.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-bxx-c159="">Passive voice consists of a&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c159="">to
                    be</em>&nbsp;verb&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c159="">(is, be, am, are, was, were, been, being</em>) and
                a past participle (such as&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c159="">stolen, pushed, or enjoyed</em>).</li>
            <li _ngcontent-bxx-c159="">The subject of the passive voice verb is receiving the action rather than doing
                the action. For example,&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c159="">The play was enjoyed by the audience</em>.
                Although&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c159="">play</em>&nbsp;is the subject, the object of the preposition
                (<em _ngcontent-bxx-c159="">audience</em>) is actually doing the enjoying. The sentence would sound much
                better if it were active:&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c159="">The audience enjoyed the play.</em></li>
            <li _ngcontent-bxx-c159="">Not all past participles indicate passive voice, however. For example, in the
                sentence&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c159="">I have listened to that song all day long</em>, “have listened”
                is not passive voice.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-bxx-c159="">Although there are some cases in which passive voice is acceptable, use active
                voice when- ever possible.</li>
        </ul>
