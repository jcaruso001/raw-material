        <p _ngcontent-quw-c179="">
          Sometimes you will be asked to figure out the meaning of a word in
          context. In this case, the question will give you the line location of
          the word. Perhaps you will have already identified the word as one
          that is unfamiliar to you. Either way, you’ll need to read the
          sentence (<strong _ngcontent-quw-c179="">and</strong>&nbsp;the ones
          immediately before and after it) to look for context clues—words in
          the sentence that give away the meaning of the target word. Be
          aware—you will encounter unfamiliar words especially in the science
          passages. They are there to intimidate you. Don’t let them.
        </p>

          You should also review your knowledge of root word, prefixes, and
          suffixes. Below are charts that will help you to do this. While you
          are not expected to memorize the information on the charts,
          familiarizing yourself with these word parts will help you to
          understand the difficult words you may encounter in the Reading
          Section of the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-quw-c179="">ACT</em>.

            >The United States and Canadian governments are mounting a defense
            against a Russian invasion. No, the clock has not been turned back.
            These invaders are Asian gypsy moths, foliage-chomping insects that
            can cause billions of dollars in damage. Experts believe they
            entered North America from Russia last year in egg masses attached
            to grain vessels. The larger Asian gypsy moth is a more voracious
            feeder than the common North American strain and can feed on Pacific
            Northwest tree species. Unlike the flightless North American female,
            an Asian female can fly 20 miles between mating and egg-laying. The
            United States Health Inspection Service is barring from West Coast
            ports ships found carrying egg masses. The Tacoma and Portland
            areas, as well as Vancouver, British Columbia, have been sprayed
            with a biopesticide.</strong

Choice A might trick some test-takers because the comparison is political in nature. However, the rest of the passage doesn’t deal with political matters at all. Choice C is incorrect for the same reason. Given the information the author provides in the passage, we can be certain that he isn’t making light of the situation (D)."},
