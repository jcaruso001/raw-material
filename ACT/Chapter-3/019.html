            <p _ngcontent-quw-c160="">Also on the English section, you may find questions such as: “If an editor wanted
                (something specific), would this essay meet his requirements?” Following the question will be two ‘yes’
                answers and two ‘no’ answers. It is your job to pick either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and then indicate which of the
                two has the correct reasoning.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-quw-c160="">You may also see a question or two of the following type: “If sentence (3) were
                deleted, what would be lost in the paragraph?” Then you would need to identify what the paragraph would
                lose if that particular sentence (or phrase) is deleted. The same is true for adding sentences or parts
                of sentences. You identify where in the paragraph the sentence would make the most sense if added.</p>
            <h3 _ngcontent-quw-c160="">Sequence</h3>
            <p _ngcontent-quw-c160="">You may also find sequence question of the following type:</p>

                <li _ngcontent-quw-c160="">Identify the correct sequence of sentence in a particular paragraph.</li>
