            <h2 _ngcontent-quw-c173="">The Reading Test</h2>
            <p _ngcontent-quw-c173="">Most students will tell you that the reading section is the most difficult part of
                the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-quw-c173="">ACT</em>. Why? Because the lengthy passages require you to stay
                focused! In order to remain alert and to concentrate during the critical reading section of the&nbsp;<em
                    _ngcontent-quw-c173="">ACT</em>, you must remember&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-quw-c173="">Rule # 1:
                    Stay engaged with the text.</strong>&nbsp;In other words, interact with the passages in front of
                you.<br _ngcontent-quw-c173=""><br _ngcontent-quw-c173="">Here’s how:</p>
            <ul _ngcontent-quw-c173="">
                <li _ngcontent-quw-c173="">First,&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-quw-c173="">write on the passage</strong>.
                    Underline information that you think may be important. Underline transitional or signal words such
                    as however,&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-quw-c173="">therefore, since, nevertheless</em>, and&nbsp;<em
                        _ngcontent-quw-c173="">above all</em>. Circle words that are unfamiliar to you. Put stars next
                    to examples the author provides. Make brief notes in the margins about the author’s purpose, point,
                    or attitude. Don’t worry about marking details like dates and percentages, though, because questions
                    that ask about specific details will often refer you to the right line number. Writing on the
                    passage serves three important purposes. It helps you to make more sense of what you’re reading, it
                    helps you to remember what you’ve read, and (here’s the clincher) it helps you to stay tuned in
                    while you’re reading!</li>
                <li _ngcontent-quw-c173="">The second way to stay engaged with the text is to&nbsp;<strong
                        _ngcontent-quw-c173="">keep a conversation going in your head while you’re reading</strong>. Go
                    ahead. No one else will know. Talk back to the author of the passage. Ask him questions like “What
                    point are you trying to make?” or “Why did you describe the situation that way?” Make accusations
                    like “Wow, you obviously don’t like this character very much” or “Well, I can tell you think global
                    warming is nothing but a scam.” Get inside his head by saying “You’re trying to be sarcastic, aren’t
                    you?” or “Oh, I see where you’re going with this example.” These conversations may feel awkward at
                    first, but good readers have them all the time. They help you to think like the author (which means
                    you’ll have an easier time answering the questions), and they help you to (once again) stay tuned in
                    to the reading!</li>
            </ul>
            <p _ngcontent-quw-c173=""><br _ngcontent-quw-c173=""><br _ngcontent-quw-c173="">Although interacting with
                the passages is important, don’t get too carried away. Keep in mind that you have a time limit, and try
                to follow these guidelines:<br _ngcontent-quw-c173=""><br _ngcontent-quw-c173=""></p>
            <ul _ngcontent-quw-c173="">
                <li _ngcontent-quw-c173="">You may want to skim the passage first to identify the topic.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-quw-c173="">Get familiar with the questions. Find out what you are looking for.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-quw-c173="">Go through the passage one time, marking it and talking to it as you go.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-quw-c173=""><strong _ngcontent-quw-c173="">Try to answer questions as you
                        read.</strong>&nbsp;This will save you time.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-quw-c173="">Read through each question and answer the ones you can immediately.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-quw-c173="">Go back to the ones about which you are unsure.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-quw-c173="">When you go back to the passage to figure these out, remember that,
                    generally, the questions follow the order of the passage. In other words, you should be able to find
                    the answer to the first question near the beginning of the passage</li>
                <li _ngcontent-quw-c173="">Answer questions that pertain to the whole passage&nbsp;<strong
                        _ngcontent-quw-c173="">last</strong>. By this time, you have worked with the whole passage and
                    the details in the passage which should lead to a sense of what the whole passage is about or how it
                    is put together.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-quw-c173="">If reading the whole passage confuses you, read a portion (a couple of
                    paragraphs or a column) and answer any questions that pertain.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-quw-c173="">You do not have to do the passages in order. Look them over and pick one that
                    looks easy or is at least interesting to you. You will do better on passages that interest
                    you.&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-quw-c173="">Remember, your goal is to get points.</strong></li>
                <li _ngcontent-quw-c173="">The passages are always in the same order on every test: Narrative, Social
                    Science, Humanities, Natural Science.</li>
            </ul>
            <p _ngcontent-quw-c173=""><br _ngcontent-quw-c173="">You’ll have to answer questions about the point of the
                passage and how the author uses his words to make a point. Specifically, you need to practice figuring
                out a passage’s main idea, the author’s attitude or tone toward the subject matter, and what the passage
                implies (says indirectly or between the lines).</p>
