                interactive action game designed to increase standardized test scores as well as enhance general
                mathematics, science, reading, and vocabulary skills. With each correct answer, students move one step
                closer to decoding a virus that international criminals have set in place to infect the United States’
                banking systems. You will be able to work on enhancing your&nbsp;<em

                in&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c260="">The Essential Guide to the ACT.</em></p>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c260="">In addition to the game, you will find skill-building exercises, along with one
                practice test (in the basic format and time frame of the real test) in each content category of
                the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c260="">ACT</em>&nbsp;to provide you with simulated experience in taking the
                actual&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c260="">ACT</em>. For each of these, we will provide the opportunity for
                you to score your test by providing the correct answers and the rationale behind each of those answers.
