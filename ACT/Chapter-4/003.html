            <h2 _ngcontent-cxv-c213="">Math Skills Review</h2>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c213="">So many students approach this section of the test with an unhealthy amount of
                fear or anxiety. Familiarizing yourself with the format of the&nbsp;<em
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c213="">ACT</em>&nbsp;math questions and becoming comfortable working with the
                equations you will need to answer the questions will help you overcome this. Approaching this part of
                the test with a positive attitude and a plan of attack will help you achieve your desired score.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c213="">The mathematical reasoning sections are designed to test your problem-solving
                abilities in topics that are generally covered in the math classes taken by most high school students.
                These topics include pre-algebra, algebra, and geometry. Although you will be tested on your knowledge
                of these subjects, it is your ability to&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-cxv-c213="">apply</strong>&nbsp;what
                you have learned that will determine your success on the test.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c213="">You will need to familiarize yourself with basic mathematical formulas. These are
                not provided for you on the test. You are being tested on your ability to apply these formulas when
                needed to arrive at the correct answers. Therefore, memorizing the formulas and their corresponding
                equations is not enough. Your comfort in applying your knowledge of what they mean is vital to success
                in solving mathematical problems on the test.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c213=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c213="">Thy Days Are Numbered: Properties of
                    Numbers</strong></p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c213="">A finite number of days remain before you are going to take the&nbsp;<em
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c213="">ACT</em>, and it is always a good idea to begin preparing well in advance.
                Remember, you have been preparing for this day for several years now. This is where all of those hours
                spent in math classes finally pay off.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c213="">For the majority of the mathematical reasoning questions, obtaining the correct
                answer will de- pend on your ability to manipulate numerical values. Approximately eighty percent (80%)
                of your answers will be a numerical value. In this section, you will review the types of numbers that
                may be encountered and some of their basic properties.</p>
