            <h2 _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">Multiples, Factors, and Primes</h2>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">A multiple of a number is any product of that number and an integer. So, 4, 8, 12,
                16, and 20 are multiples of 4 because 4 x 1 = 4, 4 x 2 = 8, 4 x 3 = 12, 4 x 4 = 16, and 4 x 5 = 20. The
                test writers are typically going to consider the positive multiples of a number. They may even refer to
                the positive multiples as simply the multiples. However, multiples of a number can be negative as well.
                Note that -4, -8, -12, -16, and -20 are also multiples of 4. Multiples of a number need not be positive
                or negative. Although the chances it will come up on the test may be small, it certainly doesn’t hurt to
                know that 0 is a multiple of every number, since 0 is an integer and any number times 0 equals 0. The
                smallest (positive) multiple shared by two numbers is called the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c215=""><strong
                        _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">least common multiple</strong></em>. The multiples of 3 and 8 are<br
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c215=""><br _ngcontent-cxv-c215=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">Multiples of
                    3</strong>: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, …<br _ngcontent-cxv-c215=""><strong
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">Multiples of 8</strong>: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, …<br
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c215=""><br _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">As you can see, the first multiple to appear in
                both lists is 24. Therefore, 24 is the least common<br _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">multiple of 3 and 8.<br
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c215=""><br _ngcontent-cxv-c215=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">A&nbsp;<em
                        _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">factor</em>&nbsp;of a number is any (positive) integer that evenly
                    divides (remainder of 0) into the</strong><br _ngcontent-cxv-c215=""><strong
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">number. The number 18</strong>&nbsp;has factors of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18
                because 18/18 =1,18/9 = 2, 18/6 = 3, 18/3 = 6, 18/2 = 9 and 18/1 = 18. Any given number is a multiple of
                each of its factors. The term greatest&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c215=""><strong
                        _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">common factor</strong></em>&nbsp;is given to&nbsp;<strong
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">the largest factor shared by two numbers</strong>. The greatest common factor
                of 21 and 28 is 7, since 7 is the largest number that is a factor of both numbers. Although it is
                unlikely that you will simply be asked to factor a number for the test, being able to factor numbers
                will be important to answering many of the questions.<br _ngcontent-cxv-c215=""><br
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c215=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">A&nbsp;<em
                        _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">prime</em>&nbsp;number is any integer greater than 1 whose only factors
                    (positive divisors) are 1 and itself</strong>. Three (3) is a prime number because the only factors
                of 3 are 1 and 3. Six (6) is not a prime number because the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Although we
                won’t get into why here, note that 1 is not considered a prime number. We can write every positive
                integer as a unique product of prime numbers. This is referred to as the&nbsp;<em
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">prime factorization</em>&nbsp;of a number. The number 4620 has a prime
                factorization of 2 • 2 • 3 • 5 • 7 • 11. The prime factorization of a number is unique; that is to say,
                there is no other combination of prime factors that will give the same product. This leads us to another
                concept that you may encounter, although probably not more than once on a given test. Two numbers are
                said to be&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">relatively prime or mutually prime</em>&nbsp;if they have no
                factors (other than 1) in common. The numbers 198 = 2 • 3 • 3 • 11 and 455 = 5 • 7 • 13 are relatively
                prime because they share no common factors in their prime factorization.<br _ngcontent-cxv-c215=""><br
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">When completely factoring a number, begin by removing any obvious factors
                such as 2, 5, and 10. This will make it easier to examine any of the less obvious factors. In factoring
                a number, the following divisibility rules will be helpful.<br _ngcontent-cxv-c215=""><br
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c215=""></p>
            <ol _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">One (1) is a factor of any whole number.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">Any even number (ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8) will be divisible by 2.<br
                        _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">312, and 256 are divisible by 2, while 221 is not.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">Add up the digits in the number. If the sum of the digits is divisible by 3,
                    then the number is divisible by 3 as well. Note that you can do this recursively for large
                    numbers.<br _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">How would you determine if the number 937, 689, 865, 863 is
                    divisible by 3?<br _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">Add up the digits: 9 + 3 + 7 + 6 + 8 + 9 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 8 +
                    6 + 3 = 78.<br _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">Is 78 divisible by 3? 7 + 8= 15 and 15 ÷ 3 = 5, so the
                    original number is divisible by 3.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">If the last two digits are divisible by 4, then the number is divisible by
                    4.<br _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">432, 235, 916 is divisible by 4 because 16 is divisible by 4.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">Any number ending in 0 or 5 is divisible by 5.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">Any even number that is divisible by 3 will be divisible by 6. (This is just
                    the combination of rules 2 and 3 above)<br _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">18 is divisible by 2 (because it
                    ends in 8) and by 3 (because 1 + 8 = 9, which is divisible by 3), so 18 is divisible by 6.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">This rule is similar to rule 3 above. If the sum of the digits is divisible
                    by 9, then the number is divisible by 9.<br _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">423,421,264,413 is divisible by 9
                    because the sum of the digits is 36 = (9 x 4).</li>
                <li _ngcontent-cxv-c215="">Any number ending in 0 is divisible by 10.</li>
