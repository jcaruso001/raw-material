            <h2 _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">Statistics</h2>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">There won’t be too many problems that cover statistics on the test, but you can be
                sure there will be at least one. It is highly unlikely that any will cover topics beyond the three most
                basic statistical measures; mean (arithmetic average), median, and mode. The mean of a set of n numbers
                is just the sum of the numbers divided by n (the number of items in the set). To find the mean or
                average of 15, 21, and 39, you would do the following:</p><img _ngcontent-cxv-c236=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1597720306/2019/ACT/Screen_Shot_2020-07-09_at_11.18.08_AM_jekh3t.png">
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">You may have to rely on your understanding of the properties of averages to arrive
                at an answer on the test when directly calculating the averages is difficult or time consuming. The
                average of two numbers is halfway between the two numbers on a number line. The average of 3 and 5 is 4.
                When you have a set of numbers evenly spaced, the average will simply be the middle number. The average
                of the first nine odd numbers will simply be the 5th odd number, or 9. When there&nbsp;is an even number
                of terms in the set, the average is just the average of the two middle numbers. The average of the first
                100 odd numbers is just the average of the 50th (99) and 51st (101) odd numbers. So, the average is 100.
            </p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">Two concepts that often appear on the test deal with weighted averages and finding
                a missing number when an average is given. The average of a set of numbers is just the sum of the
                numbers divided by the number of terms in the set.</p><img _ngcontent-cxv-c236=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1597720337/2019/ACT/Screen_Shot_2020-07-09_at_11.18.41_AM_pt4f9r.png">
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236=""><br _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">Likewise, we can use the average and the number of
                terms to calculate the sum of the terms.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">Sum of terms = (Average) x (# of terms)</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">This principle is central to both calculating a missing term and to the concept of
                a weighted aver- age. If we are given the value for three of the four terms (17, 35, 39) and the average
                (34) we can calculate the value of the missing term.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">Sum of terms = 17 + 35 + 39 + x = 34 • 4 = 136<br _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">91 + x =
                136<br _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">x = 45</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">If we are given that (in a class of 16 girls and 13 boys) the boys averaged 75 on
                the last exam and the girls averaged 83, we can calculate the class average using a weighted average.
                Note that the average is not just the average of the boys’ and girls’ test averages.</p><img
                _ngcontent-cxv-c236=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1597720366/2019/ACT/Screen_Shot_2020-07-09_at_11.29.20_AM_hbcxkr.png">
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">The average is slightly closer to 83 than it is to 75 because there are more girls
                in the class than boys.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">The median of a set of data is just the term in the middle once the terms have
                been ordered from least to greatest. If there are two numbers in the middle of the data, simply take the
                average of the two terms. The mode of a set of data is the term that appears the most often. Finally,
                the range of a set of data is the value of the largest term minus the least term.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">Example: Find the median, mode, and range of the set</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">5, 6, 9, 3, 10, 6, 11, 13</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">To find the median we must first put the numbers in order from least to greatest.
            </p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">3, 5, 6, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">There are two terms in the middle, 6 and 9. We must find their average.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">6 + 9/ 2<br _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">= 15/2<br _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">= 7.5<br
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">The median is 7.5</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">To find the mode we identify which number shows up the most often.<br
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">The mode is 6</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">To find the range we subtract the largest term and the least term.<br
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">13 – 5 = 8<br _ngcontent-cxv-c236="">The range is 8</p>
