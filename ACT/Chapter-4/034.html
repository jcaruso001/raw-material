            <h2 _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">Variations</h2>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">Variations explain, in mathematical language, how one quantity changes with
                respect to one or more other quantities. The amount of flour needed in a bread recipe varies with the
                number of loaves being made. The time it takes to paint a house varies with the number of people doing
                the work. The first is an example of&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">direct variation</em>; the second
                is an example of&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">inverse variation</em>.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">In the example of direct variation given above, the amount of flour needed for the
                recipe will vary directly with the number of loaves being made. Making more loaves will require more
                flour; making fewer loaves will require less flour. In direct variation, the variables will move in the
                same direction. As one variable increases or decreases, the other variable will move in the same
                direction. These problems can be solved using proportions. Consider the example below:</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">If it takes 3 gallons of paint to cover 100 ft^2,<br _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">how
                many gallons of paint will be needed to cover 600 ft^2?</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">The problem gives us the ratio of 3 gallons of paint to every 100 ft^2. We can use
                this to set up a<br _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">proportion problem.</p><img _ngcontent-cxv-c246=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1597719452/2019/ACT/Screen_Shot_2020-07-09_at_10.31.15_AM_1_esf3tj.png">
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">It will take 18 gallons of paint to cover the 600 ft^2. The expression “y varies
                directly as x” is<br _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">also written as</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">y = kx</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">where k is called the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">constant of variation</em>.
                In the previous problem, the number of gallons of paint varies directly with the square footage of wall
                that will be covered. The constant of variation is 3/100. We would then have</p><img
                _ngcontent-cxv-c246=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1597719106/2019/ACT/Screen_Shot_2020-07-09_at_10.33.10_AM_dg2x4q.png">
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">When two variables or quantities change in opposite directions, this is an example
                of inverse variation. In the example above about painting a house, the time required to paint the house
                varies inversely with the number of people painting. This means that the more people painting the house,
                the less total time it will take to paint. When we say “y varies inversely with x”, we can express this
                as</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">y = k/x</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">Again,&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">k is the constant of
                    variation</strong>. We can find k by simply multiplying the known values for<br
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">the two variables. Consider the example below.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">A particular hotel has a custodial staff of 12 employees, and they can typically
                clean all of the hotel rooms in 6 hours. If four members of the custodial staff are not at work today,
                how long will it take the remaining custodians to clean all of the hotel rooms?</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">In the example above, the total time taken to complete the job, y, is inversely
                proportional to the number of workers, x. The constant of variation k is simply 6 • 12 = 72. We can thus
                solve the problem as follows:</p><img _ngcontent-cxv-c246=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1597719106/2019/ACT/Screen_Shot_2020-07-09_at_10.33.10_AM_dg2x4q.png">
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">The correct answer is 9 hours. I hope you recognized that the number of workers
                present is 8. There are four custodians absent, so x = 12 – 4 = 8. Be sure to read the information
                provided in the problems carefully.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">Two additional types of variation problems that we will discuss are&nbsp;<em
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">joint variation</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">combined
                    variation</em>. These are just extensions of direct and inverse variation. When we say that “y
                varies jointly with x and z,” we have an example of&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">joint
                    variation</em>. This can be written as</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">y = kxz ,</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">where k is again the constant of variation. The constant of variation is simply
                the ratio of y to x and z. Consider the problem below.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">The variable y varies jointly with x and z.<br _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">y = 12, when
                x = 4and z = 8.<br _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">What is the value of y when x = 6 and z = 10?</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">First, we want to be sure that we recognize the type of variation that is present.
                It is pretty simple for this problem: “y varies jointly with x and z.” We thus have the form:</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">y = kxy,</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">and we simply need to determine the value for the k.</p><img
                _ngcontent-cxv-c246=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1597719109/2019/ACT/Screen_Shot_2020-07-09_at_10.40.56_AM_xmdnws.png">
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">Now, we simply plug this into the equation of variation and solve for our unknown.
            </p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">y = (3/8) xy<br _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">= 3/8 • 6 • 10<br _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">=
                45/2<br _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">= 22 1/2</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">The correct answer is 22 1/2.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246=""><em _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">Combined variation</em>&nbsp;involves both direct and
                inverse variation. For example, if we say “y varies directly with x and inversely with z,” this is an
                example of combined variation. This can be written:</p><img _ngcontent-cxv-c246=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1597719111/2019/ACT/Screen_Shot_2020-07-09_at_10.46.45_AM_xinmbd.png">
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">Consider the following example.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">It takes 2 hours for 3 people to paint 100 ft. of 6-ft. fencing. Assuming that
                each person is capable of painting at the same rate, how long will it take for 12 people to paint 1,800
                ft. of the same fencing?</p>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">The total time, t, needed to paint a section of fencing is directly proportional
                to the length of the fence, l, and inversely proportional to the number of people, n, who are painting.
            </p><img _ngcontent-cxv-c246=""

            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">We simply need to determine the constant of variation, k.</p><img
                _ngcontent-cxv-c246=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1597719118/2019/ACT/Screen_Shot_2020-07-09_at_10.47.59_AM_knhs6n.png">
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">Now that we have k, we need to substitute it into the equation of variation to get
                the answer.</p><img _ngcontent-cxv-c246=""
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dldxizzkr/image/upload/v1597719119/2019/ACT/Screen_Shot_2020-07-09_at_10.48.22_AM_an08sx.png">
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c246="">The correct answer is 9 hours.</p>
