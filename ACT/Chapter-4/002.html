            <h2 _ngcontent-cxv-c163="">Essay Prompt</h2>
            <p _ngcontent-cxv-c163="">The following is an example of an ACT essay prompt. It and several others may be
                found in McGraw Hillâ€™s 10 ACT tests. The book also includes 10 complete ACT practice tests.<br
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c163=""><br _ngcontent-cxv-c163="">Directions: You have forty (40) minutes to read
                the writing prompt and pan and write your essay. Use the lined pages provided at the beginning of the

                    TRANSLATORS</strong><br _ngcontent-cxv-c163=""><br _ngcontent-cxv-c163="">Virtual translators are
                computer programs that are capable of instant translation between human languages, even languages that
                use different character alphabets. They are available free of charge on various websites. Translating
                services that employ multilingual human beings are on the decline. As our world becomes increasingly
                interconnected, consumers have more need of translation services. That need is more and more likely to
                be filled by free automated web services. As a result, some have argued that there is less value in
                being multilingual. It is worth considering whether technology is changing our appreciate of learning
                other languages.<br _ngcontent-cxv-c163=""><br _ngcontent-cxv-c163=""><strong
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c163="">Perspective One:&nbsp;</strong>Digital technology and the Internet are
                changing our relationship with languages. Free translation is so plentiful and available that the value
                of learning a foreign language has been diminished significantly.<br _ngcontent-cxv-c163=""><br
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c163=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c163="">Perspective Two:</strong>&nbsp;Virtual
                translation may be helpful for translating simple business emails. However, the subtleties and
                connotation are often lost. There will always be a place for human beings in creating full and complete
                translations of important communications and works of art.<br _ngcontent-cxv-c163=""><br
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c163=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c163="">Perspective Three:&nbsp;</strong>The
                availability of virtual translators has opened up new possibilities and actually aids in the learning of
                new languages. Tools that were previously unavailable can be used to assist in learning and mastering
                new languages, making it easier than ever to become multilingual.<br _ngcontent-cxv-c163=""><br
                    _ngcontent-cxv-c163=""><strong _ngcontent-cxv-c163="">Essay Task</strong><br
