            <h2 _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">Chapter One: Essential Facts</h2>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c157=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">What is the&nbsp;<em
                        _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">ACT</em>?</strong></p>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">The&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">American College Testing
                    (ACT)</em>&nbsp;examination measures skill in four areas: English, reading, science, and
                mathematics. In addition, there is an optional writing test offered in a version of the exam
                called&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">ACT</em>&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">Plus Writing</em>.
                The&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">ACT</em>&nbsp;is designed and developed by American College Testing
                in keeping with standards and codes set by the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">National Council on
                    Measurement in Education</em>,&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">The American Psychological
                    Association</em>,&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">The American Educational Research
                    Association</em>, and&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">The Joint Committee on Testing Practices</em>.
                Students are allocated 2 hours and 55 minutes to answer the two hundred and fifteen (215)
                multiple-choice questions on the exam. The optional writing section requires an additional 40 minutes of
                testing time. Since some colleges require the writing test, you should check with the colleges to which
                you are applying to ascertain whether this portion of the&nbsp;<em
                    _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">ACT</em>&nbsp;is a requirement. It is a good idea to do the essay in any case
                because it demonstrates your willingness to “go the extra mile.”</p>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">Each of the four test areas of the&nbsp;<em
                    _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">ACT</em>&nbsp;(English, mathematics, reading, and science) is scored 1 to 36,
                with 36 being the highest possible score. These four test scores are then averaged and rounded to the
                nearest whole number to obtain a composite score from 1 to 36. If you take the&nbsp;<em
                    _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">ACT Plus Writing</em>, your essay will be evaluated by two professional
                readers who will assess the overall quality of your written expression and award your essay with a
                subscore. The writing score will not be included in the overall scale score. (For details regarding the

                        _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">ACT</em>?</strong></p>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">As a college entrance examination, the&nbsp;<em
                    _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">ACT</em>&nbsp;is taken by high school juniors and seniors. Along with a
                record of your academic performance (the high school transcript), evidence of involvement in
                extracurricular activities, recommendations, essays, and other supportive documents — the&nbsp;<em
                    _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">ACT</em>&nbsp;is accepted by the majority of the colleges and universities in
                the United States as a part of the application profile. The&nbsp;<em
                    _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">ACT</em>&nbsp;is administered five times per year between October and June;
                however, some states also offer the exam in late September as well.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">Since the exam measures mathematics skills through the third year of college
                preparatory study, we recommend that you take your first ACT no earlier than the spring of your junior
                year in high school unless you are highly advanced in your academic work. If you wish to try to improve
                your initial score, you should take the exam again in June or in the first semester of your senior year,
                prior to your college application deadlines.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c157=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">How do I register for the ACT and what fees
                    apply?</strong></p>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c157=""><em _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">ACT</em>&nbsp;test registration materials are available
                in your high school guidance or college counseling office. You will find test dates and registration
                deadlines posted in both of these locations as well.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">You can also register online at www.actstudent.org/regist/elecreg, where you will
                find the testing dates for the current year. At this website, you will also find high school, college,
                and test center codes and information about eligibility for fee waivers and special circumstances
                related to&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">ACT</em>&nbsp;testing. Whether you register by mail or
                online, it is wise to read the registration material carefully, since other fees may apply under various
                conditions.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">The basic fees for taking the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">ACT</em>&nbsp;are
                outlined in the registration materials for the exam. These charges cover the administration of the test
                and your score report and allow you to send your scores to as many as four colleges.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c157="">Fee waiver information is also available through your guidance or college
                counselor, and fee waiver cards can only be procured from the counselor, even for online registration.
                Home- schooled students must provide the local high school proof of eligibility for fee waivers. To use
                the card, you must register for the ACT exams according to posted regular deadlines.</p>
