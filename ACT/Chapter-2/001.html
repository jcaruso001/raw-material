            <h2 _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Chapter Two: Test-Taking Tips</h2>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">In this and the next three chapters, we will focus on reviewing skills related to
                the areas tested on the ACT. Along with skill review, you will find tips and strategies for tackling
                specific types of questions. This chapter will concentrate on general tips for taking standardized
                college entrance tests. While we cannot guarantee that these tips will work for every student, you
                should consider them as good advice for any test-taker.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Nora, a student who recently took the ACT, offers the following advice:</p>
            <ul _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Dress in layers and bring a sweater or
                        jacket.<br _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""></strong>Test sites use the cafeteria, auditorium, or other
                    spaces that are large enough to hold all of the test takers, but schools often turn off the heat or
                    air conditioning on the weekends. It is difficult to concentrate when you are too hot or too cold.
                </li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Bring a standard watch.<br
                            _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""></strong>Basic time management is up to you! The proctors tell you
                    how much time you have for each section, when to start, when to stop, and when you have 5 minutes
                    left. You should pay attention to how long you are taking on the questions and pace yourself during
                    the test. i-watches and other devices that can be linked to the Web are prohibited.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Skip hard questions or use your best guess.<br
                            _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""></strong>You can usually narrow your choices down to two possible
                    correct answers. That will give you a 50% chance of answering the questions correctly. (We will
                    cover guessing in more detail below.) Never leave a question unanswered.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Replace, in your mind, long hard story
                        character names like Jedidiah, Beauregard, Shaneequa with Bill or Jane or just use the first
                        letter of the name for each character.<br _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""></strong>You can get lost in
                    the names and it can draw your attention away from the question.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Read carefully!<br
                            _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""></strong>Make sure you understand the main idea of the story. Ask
                    yourself these two questions:<br _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">1) What is the story about -- the
                    subject?<br _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">2) How does the subject of the story relate to the questions?
                </li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Review the basic concepts</strong>&nbsp;—
                    arithmetic operations and their order in solving problems, algebraic formulas, etc.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Prepare yourself by studying a few days of
                        basic math formulas</strong>&nbsp;a week before the test (Example: A=bh2).</li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Know how to solve word
                        problems</strong>&nbsp;and how to apply basic formulas to them.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Know how to solve 3-D and 2-D shape
                        problems</strong>&nbsp;involving circumference, perimeter, and area.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Be prepared for lots of questions using
                        algebra.</strong>&nbsp;(Example: 2x = 4 or xy = 0)</li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Be aware that a few questions may include
                        seldom-used units of measurement</strong>, such as stones. The key is to use “proportion.” Do
                    not worry about the unit. Usually it is the numbers connected with the unit type that are the most
                    important. (Example: If 100 bags of sand weigh 300 stones, how much would 170 bags weigh? Simply
                    cross multiply to find the answer.) You should, however, know basic units of measurement and how to
                    convert one into another. (Example: How many quarts are in 2 galloons?)</li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Bring a graphing calculator.<br
                            _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""></strong>It will help in converting decimals to fractions and vice
                    versa, with square root, etc., and will save a lot of time. Make sure it is fully charged and/or
                    bring fresh batteries or a back-up calculator. Practice with the calculator you are going to use
                    before the test.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Sharpen your science skills</strong>&nbsp;in
                    reading and understanding graphs, charts, tables, and other schematic forms. Review the scientific
                    terms you have learned in your high school science courses. You will not be asked the meaning of
                    specific science vocabulary, but the test expects you to already have a certain amount of background
                    scientific knowledge.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Familiarize yourself</strong>&nbsp;with
                    reading and understanding scientific research summaries. Be able to recognize and understand related
                    and conflicting viewpoints when reading scientific data. Review the steps and concepts related to
                    the scientific method.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Write on the test!</strong>&nbsp;Underline
                    important material and make notes that might help you answer the questions correctly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><br _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">To Guess or Not to
                    Guess?</strong></p>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">As mentioned above, the question of guessing on the responses to the&nbsp;<em
                    _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">ACT</em>&nbsp;is a common one. While some would say that guessing is
                cheating, it is important to understand that there is no penalty for wrong answers on the&nbsp;<em
                    _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">ACT</em>. Therefore, you should always guess if you do not know the answer to
                an&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">ACT</em>&nbsp;question. Before you guess, however, you should try
                to&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">eliminate at least one wrong answer before choosing a
                    response.</strong>&nbsp;(Eliminating two is even better!) Guessing wisely rather than randomly will
                increase the likelihood that your guess will yield the right answer.</p>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c158=""><strong _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Some Final Thoughts</strong>Other general
                test-taking advice includes the following:</p>
            <ul _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Get a good night’s sleep before the test.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Eat a light breakfast and take a snack and something to drink for break
                    times.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Arrive at the test site early or on time.(You will not be allowed to take the
                    test if you are late!)</li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Along with a watch and calculator, bring several sharpened #2 pencils and
                    erasers.</li>
                <li _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">Try to relax; then concentrate on following directions and answering the
                    questions to the best of your ability.</li>
            </ul>
            <p _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">By utilizing these tips and strategies along with those offered in Chapters 3, 4,
                and 5, you will increase your chances for success in taking the&nbsp;<em
                    _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">ACT</em>. So, jump right in, review the comments provided in this guide, play
                the game, and have fun preparing for the&nbsp;<em _ngcontent-bxx-c158="">ACT</em>!</p>
