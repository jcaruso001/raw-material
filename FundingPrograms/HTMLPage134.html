        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c70="" class="mt-5">The Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) covers four sections of ASVAB: Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, Arithmetic Reasoning, and Mathematics Knowledge. These four sections and your scores on them make up the Military Entrance Score, also known as the AFQT. The higher the AFQT score, the better to achieve educational opportunities, critical skills the military is looking for. It can also result in higher enlistment bonuses. </p>

        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c70="" class="mt-5">There are quite a few jobs in the military which require fluency in a foreign language. Department of Defense uses two primary tests to determine whether someone can obtain one of these jobs. The first test is the Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT). This test is designed for individuals who are already fluent in a specific foreign language needed by the military. Quite simply, it tests the individual's current knowledge of a specific language. However, most people trying to obtain a job which requires foreign language proficiency are not currently fluent in a needed language. In that case, The DOD uses the Defense Language Aptitude Battery (or DLAB) to measure one's aptitude to learn a foreign language. An enlistment bonus, a critical military occupational specialty with probable re-enlistment bonuses and post-military career opportunities are but a few of the significant benefits of launching into this field of endeavor. </p>
