        <h2 _ngcontent-mqv-c61="">Credit and Bonus Programs</h2><iframe _ngcontent-mqv-c61="" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FUkczOjoQZc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p _ngcontent-mqv-c61="" class="mt-5">In addition to the tuition support programs, there are other benefits and programs offered by the uniformed services that can be of benefit to you. Those are&nbsp;College Credit for Military Experience, Officer Candidate School, Concurrent Admissions Program,&nbsp;and Enlistment Bonuses.&nbsp;</p><p _ngcontent-mqv-c61="">Did you know you can get college credit for your military experience? The&nbsp;American Council on Education (ACE)&nbsp;collaborates with&nbsp;Department of&nbsp;Defense&nbsp;to review military training and experience and recommend appropriate college credit for members of the Armed Forces. ACE provides quality assurance and policy guidance for the&nbsp;Joint Services Transcript (JST)&nbsp;used by the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Coast Guard.&nbsp;</p><p _ngcontent-mqv-c61="">JST is an academically accepted document to validate a service member's military occupational experience and training along with the corresponding ACE college credit recommendations. More than&nbsp;2,300 colleges and universities&nbsp;recognize these transcripts as official documentation of military training and experiences and applicable ACE credit recommendations.&nbsp;</p><p _ngcontent-mqv-c61="">Officer Candidate School, or OCS,&nbsp;is generally open to qualified enlisted Noncommissioned Officers, along with civilians who hold at least&nbsp;a four-year college degree. Candidates who successfully complete the rigorous,&nbsp;9 to&nbsp;12-week&nbsp;school&nbsp;receive formal commissions as Officers and assume the ability to&nbsp;command&nbsp;soldiers, sailors, or airmen.&nbsp;At graduation, you will be given a formal commission as&nbsp;an&nbsp;Officer and assigned to the rank of&nbsp;Second Lieutenant&nbsp;or Ensign, the lowest of the commissioned ranks. You will be recognized as a leader in the nation's first and best line of defense.&nbsp;</p><p _ngcontent-mqv-c61="">The&nbsp;Concurrent Admissions Program&nbsp;(ConAP) is a partnership between the Army Recruiting Command and over 1,900 participating colleges to mutually advance the goals of lifelong learning and postsecondary education for Future Soldiers. </p><p _ngcontent-mqv-c61="">The program's purpose is to&nbsp;link Future Soldiers to a&nbsp;ConAP&nbsp;college&nbsp;at the time of enlistment in the Army or Army Reserve. During the enlistment process, Army and Army Reserve recruiters refer Future Soldiers to&nbsp;ConAP&nbsp;colleges, typically&nbsp;in their home areas. The Future Soldier submits a College Referral and Intent to Enroll form to a&nbsp;ConAP&nbsp;college stating his/her&nbsp;intent to enroll during or after their enlistment. The college acknowledges the&nbsp;Intent to&nbsp;Enroll form and sends information about the college to the Future Soldier. The&nbsp;ConAP&nbsp;form provides guidelines about applying for admission, preparing for the academic experience,&nbsp;beginning college work during enlistment, and staying in touch with the college.&nbsp;The intent is for Soldiers to&nbsp;complete college while on&nbsp;tour of duty&nbsp;or&nbsp;transition directly from the Army or Army Reserves to their&nbsp;ConAP&nbsp;college.&nbsp;</p><p _ngcontent-mqv-c61="">Did you know that you could possibly earn a&nbsp;signing bonus&nbsp;at enlistment?&nbsp;Most bonuses are paid for&nbsp;enlisting in a specific job.&nbsp;Enlistment&nbsp;bonuses are continually changing depending on recruitment&nbsp;needs. Make sure to ask your recruiter for&nbsp;a list of the specialties offering bonuses.&nbsp;It may be one you have an interest in and an aptitude for.&nbsp;Some bonuses&nbsp;may&nbsp;require enlisting longer than the normal&nbsp;three or&nbsp;four-year enlistment.&nbsp;</p><p _ngcontent-mqv-c61="">Accelerated promotion&nbsp;is offered under several methods. You may be eligible if you:&nbsp;</p><ul _ngcontent-mqv-c61=""><li _ngcontent-mqv-c61="">Were&nbsp;a&nbsp;Boy Scout&nbsp;Eagle&nbsp;Scout&nbsp;or&nbsp;a&nbsp;Girl Scout Gold Award recipient.&nbsp;</li><li _ngcontent-mqv-c61="">Have&nbsp;college credit&nbsp;or have already earned a college degree.&nbsp;</li><li _ngcontent-mqv-c61="">Were a member of the&nbsp;Civil Air Patrol.&nbsp;</li><li _ngcontent-mqv-c61="">Participated in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Junior Reserve Officer Training&nbsp;Corps&nbsp;(JROTC)&nbsp;in high school.&nbsp;</li></ul><p _ngcontent-mqv-c61="">
            Each service's rules vary, and usually the highest advancement is to&nbsp;E-3.

            Special Forces Recruitment:&nbsp;The Army, Navy, and Air Force offer special incentives for recruits who sign up for&nbsp;special forces programs&nbsp;such as Airborne or Air Assault.&nbsp;These programs are extremely&nbsp;competitive,&nbsp;and you should only consider the Special Forces if you are in&nbsp;great physical and mental shape.&nbsp;
