        <h2 _ngcontent-mqv-c71="">Packaging College Military Options</h2>
        <iframe _ngcontent-mqv-c71="" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IaRG4dE2OCI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c71="">Let’s look at how a typical military package could be put together for limited commitment and maximum financial benefit - typical National Guard or Reserve Programs netting as much as $60,000 in educational benefits in 4 years.</p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c71="">Here is the situation; you have been admitted or are currently enrolled in a college program. You have been considering a career or a career jump-start in the armed forces but want to increase your chances of completing your degree first, so you join the National Guard or Reserves Program. First, you will complete Basic Training and Advanced Individual Specialty Training or AIT. There are 2 major benefits to this training - first, the money - somewhere between $6,000 and $10,000 depending on the length of AIT. Next, most colleges award between 3 and 6 college credit hours for this training. NOTE: Work with your Recruiter to insure you time your “ship” date for basic training to allow you to miss as few semesters as possible. In most cases you can arrange to only miss 1 semester. For the next two years you will collect approximately $8,000 in drill pay for one weekend a month and your two-week annual training.</p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c71="">Now the GI Bill. Selective Reserves pays $286 per academic month for up to 36 months. According to the VA this soldier would be eligible for 60% of in-state tuition + housing allowance of up to $716 per month and $600 annually for books. Then add the GI Bill kicker of $350 per month for 12 months provided by the Reserve component programs or up to $4,200.</p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c71="">During your junior year, become a member or SMP with your unit and ROTC Program on campus. SMP benefits include: </p>
        <ul _ngcontent-mqv-c71="" class="mx-5">
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c71="">Up to 100% tuition and fees paid </li>
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c71="">Cash enlistment bonus, depending on MOS </li>
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c71="">$450 monthly ROTC stipend </li>
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c71="">$274.84 monthly (E5) drill pay </li>
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c71="">$309/month GI Bill </li>
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c71="">$350/month GI Bill Kicker </li>
        </ul>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c71="">
            The GI Bill Kicker adds $350 per month in increased kicker incentives. You also receive ROTC stipend pay at this point which is $450 a month as a junior and $500 a month as a senior which adds up to $9,500 in the last two years of college. Also consider the $13,000 for federal tuition assistance, a stipend paid to reserve component members to pay for college tuition costs, and the possibility of $3,000 to $8,000 in enlistment bonuses; you could receive up to $21,000 in bonuses. All said and done over the course of a 4-year college program, you could earn up to $66,000 in educational benefits if you work with a reserve component in college.

        </p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c71="">
            One last note – Officers beginning active duty with 2 or more years of time in service for pay, which is what you would have completed during your college years, make on average $700 per month more than those officers coming right out of college. And that keeps going up as you rise in rank. The total in a 20-year career is close to $300,000. Reserve programs really pay off both in and out of college.
