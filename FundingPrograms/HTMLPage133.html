            <strong _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">OTC Scholarships</strong>. Now here are some tips for applying for and being accepted by a Service Academy and winning an ROTC scholarship.
        </p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">
            <strong _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">Start early</strong> - Start learning about the academy application process in your freshman year of high school. Start preparing for submitting application forms and nomination forms in your junior year for appointment to an academy and for a 4-year ROTC scholarship.
        </p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">
            <strong _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">Good Academics</strong> - The Service Academies get approximately ten applications for each student position available. Applicants come from every state in the nation. The students are generally in the top 10 – 20% of their class. You will be competing with the best students in the country so doing well in all your high school classes is very important. Competition for an ROTC scholarship is almost as keen. A minimum GPA of 3.5 and scores of 1,000 on the SAT or an ACT score of 20 are required for an ROTC scholarship. And while minimum scores for admission to an Academy are stated only as “above average”, the average GPA is 3.9, SAT score is 1300 and ACT score is 30.
        </p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">
            <strong _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">Take the ACT and SAT more than once</strong> – Studies show that scores improve with repeated testing. Plan to take the test as a sophomore and then again as a junior.
            <br _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">
        </p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">
            <strong _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">Be physically fit</strong> - As physical training is a daily part of military training, the academies and ROTC programs are looking for candidates who can complete the rigors of their physical fitness program. In addition to attending classes, students at the academies participate in sports and physical fitness training year-round. So, participate in high school sports, get a varsity letter in a sport or multiple sports if possible. Being the star athlete is not as important as becoming a team captain in your sport. The academies develop officers and they want candidates with leadership potential.
        </p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">
            <strong _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">Be well-rounded</strong> - The academies and ROTC programs want candidates with Character. Graduates of the academies and ROTC will become officers in the military services. These future young officers need strong leadership skills and must be young men and women of good character. The academies and the Services are looking for candidates who already show potential for leadership and officer development. So, become involved in your school and community.
        </p>
        <ol _ngcontent-mqv-c75="" class="mx-5">
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">Work in your school’s student government. Become an officer in the student government. </li>
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">Join the Band, GleeClub, Yearbook committee or other school club. Whenever possible, be a leader in the organization or club rather than just a member. </li>
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">Join scouting or youth groups in your community. Again, learn to be a leader in those organizations.</li>
            <li _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">Do volunteer work in your community. The academies are called Service Academies for a reason; they are looking for young men and women who are willing to give to their community and country.</li>
        </ol>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c75=""></p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">
            <strong _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">Attend Candidate Orientations</strong> - These events give you a chance to learn about student life at the academies. Often there are current academy students at these events, and they will give a very REAL assessment of what their life is like. They are honest and will tell you both the GOOD and BAD. They are often your best source of information for determining if academy life will be right for you.
        </p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">
            <strong _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">Contact Admission Officers Early</strong> - Each academy has officers (retired or active duty) who assist candidates with the application process. Their goal is helping the right candidates get accepted to the academy. Getting to know your local Admissions Officer early will really be helpful when it finally becomes time to submit the application.
        </p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">
            <strong _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">Visit your Senate and Congressional Websites</strong> - In addition to an application, potential candidates need a nomination from their State Senator or Congressman. The website of each representative has information about how to apply for a nomination from their office. Getting a nomination is highly competitive, with strict guidelines on how and when to submit the nomination application. The best time to submit the application is early in summer or fall of your junior year.
        </p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">
            <strong _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">Consider attending one of the Summer Seminars</strong> - During these week-long seminars, you live in the dorm for a week and get to directly experience life as a cadet or midshipmen. As the number of openings in these seminars is limited, getting a spot in the seminar program is also competitive. Applications for the summer programs are made online December to February of your junior year. This experience will give you a real feel for academy life.
        </p>
        <p _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">
            <strong _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">Have back-up </strong>
            <strong _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">p</strong>
            <strong _ngcontent-mqv-c75="">lans</strong> - Apply to other colleges. Most people who apply will NOT receive an appointment to an academy. It is important to have other plans for college. Apply for Army, Navy, and Air Force ROTC scholarships. Apply to colleges with ROTC programs. Many fine officers are commissioned through college ROTC programs. For many students, the ROTC program at a civilian college gives students the best of both worlds, military training and a civilian college experience. Plus, the ROTC program gives 4-year, 3-year, and 2-year educational scholarships to help pay for college.
