                        processes. Photosynthesis, occurring in plants, converts light energy into chemical energy,
                        producing oxygen as a byproduct. Cellular respiration, occurring in both plants and animals,
                        uses oxygen to release energy from food. These processes are crucial for sustaining life on
                        Earth." </p>
