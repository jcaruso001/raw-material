</p><ul _ngcontent-fbe-c371=""><li _ngcontent-fbe-c371=""><p _ngcontent-fbe-c371=""><b _ngcontent-fbe-c371="">Adequate Sleep:</b> Make sure to get regular, good quality sleep in the week leading up to the test.

By reviewing key concepts, building your confidence, and staying healthy, you'll set yourself up for the best possible performance on the ASVAB. Remember, this preparation isn't just about passing a test—it's about laying the groundwork for your future career in the military. Approach this time with seriousness and dedication, reflecting on how each step prepares you not only for the test but for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in your military journey.
